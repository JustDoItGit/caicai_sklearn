Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league\\ngame is more based on skill than in NHL.

Even if\\n  the difficulties of the darker centuries immediately preceding the\\n  fourteenth are minimized, it is easy to understand the attraction which\\n  Ottoman life, particularly when compared to life in Europe, held for the\\n  Jews. There is no way to tell how many Jews left Christendom for the\\n  realm of the rising Muslim Ottomans, but with each account of persecution\\n  in or expulsion from Christian countries it is recorded that some Jews\\n  fled to Ottoman territory. The regularity of these reports suggests that\\n  the Ottomans were considered reasonably tolerant protectors and that\\n  there was a regular trickle of Jewish families moving southward and\\n  eastward from Western and Central Europe. (...) It is evident that the\\n  effects of plague, late crusades, and the general intolerance and\\n  persecution of Jews in Christian Europe resulted in the redirection\\n  of the whole focus of Jewish life which, for more than two centuries,\\n  was to be oriented toward Muslim East.>>\\n\\n\\n  page 21:\\n\\n  <<In the second quarter of the fifteenth century the foremost official\\n  in the  Edirne Jewish community was Rabbi Yitzhak Sarfati the Ashkenazi\\n  Chief Rabbi of the city. He was the most important rabbi in the city and\\n  the author of an important letter which tells us something of the situation\\n  of the Edirne Jewry in the fifteenth century. Sarfati himself was from\\n  Christian Europe and supposedly wrote this letter at the behest of two\\n  recent arrivals from there, who, upon seeing the prosperity and freedom\\n  of the Ottoman Jews, prevailed upon him to write their European\\n  coreligionists apprising them of the situation and urging them to migrate.\\n  This remarkable letter advised its recipients not only of the pleasant\\n  conditions in the Ottoman domains, but described as well the ease of\\n  travel to Palestine and the holy places, an attraction to those who\\n  would make a pilgrimage or choose to be buried there.>> (*)\\n\\n\\n  page 41:\\n\\n <<...the impression gained from the Hebrew sources is that the Jews were\\n firmly aware of the community of interests which existed between them\\n and the Ottomans, especially in comparison to relations with the Christians\\n of Europe.\\n\\n Confirmation of the commonality of interests between Muslims and Jews is\\n also indicated by the fact that European Christians perceived the Jews\\n as allies of Islam and were well aware of Muslim-Jewish cooperation.\\n Certainly the activity of important Jewish financiers and politicians\\n representing the Ottoman government abroad did not pass unnoticed. European\\n sources are the basis for much of our knowledge of their careers. In addition\\n it appears that Christian pirates plundered \\'\\'Turks and Jews,\\'\\'  their\\n sworn enemies, and that Europeans considered the Jews to be agents who\\n regularly reported to the Ottomans.\\n\\n There are well-known examples of overt Jewish support for the Ottomans\\n in the struggle against European powers. The two best known instances\\n of Jewish support for the campaigning Ottomans are the frequently cited\\n instances of the Jewish contributions to the conquests of Buda, in the\\n early sixteenth century, and of Rhodes. We also have reports of sympathy\\n for the Ottomans during the siege of Chios. An unpublished Ottoman\\n document shows dramatically the mutual interests which existed in some\\n Greek towns...>>\\n\\n page 43:\\n\\n  <<It is clear that throughout the sixteenth century it was a generally\\n accepted fact that the interests of Jews and Muslims coincided frequently,\\n and all parties involved, Jews, Muslims, and Christians, were aware of\\n the situation.>>\\n\\n\\n page 46:\\n\\n <<...it seems that the relations between Greeks and Jews were not\\n particularly cordial. The two groups had little in common, few common\\n interests, and perceived no common philosophical or religious tradition\\n which could serve as the basis for cooperation, rather than enmity. If\\n there was any identifiable bond of good will which existed between\\n religious communities in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, it was\\n that between Muslims and Jews, neither of whom had much in common with\\n the Orthodox.>>\\n\\n page 46:\\n\\n <<The general impression of Muslim-Jewish relations in the Ottoman context\\n during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is one of community of\\n interests. From the earliest times the Ottomans seem to have welcomed\\n Jews to their territory and to have found in the communities already\\n existing in places which they conquered a cooperative element. The Jewish\\n response to this tolerance was a steady flow of Jews from Christian\\n countries to Ottoman domains.>>\\n\\n page 151:\\n\\n  <<From the period before 1453 we have only a few indications that the\\n  Ottoman-Jewish relationship was well on the course of amity which would\\n  characterize it for years afterward, but the liberality of the Ottomans,\\n  in contrast to the intolerance of the Byzantines, and the protection and\\n  the security which the Ottomans offered, in comparison to conditions\\n  elsewhere, leave little doupt that even then both the Ottomans and the\\n  Jews recognized their mutual interests...>>\\n\\n  page 161:\\n\\n  <<It is impossible to say how fundamental the Jews were in the success\\n  of the Ottomans in rebuilding Istanbul or in Ottoman mercantile success\\n  in the sixteenth century. That they played an important role in both\\n  cannot be doupted. It is also unclear whether they were important enough\\n  to say that the Ottomans would not have experienced their great success\\n  without the Jews and that no other group could have been found to serve\\n  the Ottomans as well as did the Jews. It is, however, unmistakably clear\\n  that there are few parallels in world history to this remarkable\\n  partnership between Jews and the non-Jewish society in which they lived.\\n  We must conclude that the Ottomans could probably not achieved their\\n  success without a group performing certain tasks for them as well as the\\n  Jews did. Certainly for the Jews of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\\n  the Ottoman Empire was a most remarkable and salubrious home.>>\\n\\n\\n(*) A version of Rabbi Sarfati\\'s [Tzarfati] letter is given by Prof.Shaw:\\n\\n  page 32:\\n\\n  <<Your cries and sobs reached us. We have been told of all the troubles\\n  and persecutions which you have to suffer in the German lands....I hear\\n  the lamentation of my brethren...The barbarous and cruel nation ruthlessly\\n  oppresses the faithful children of the chosen people...The priests and\\n  prelates of Rome have risen. They wish to root out the memory of Jacob\\n  and erase the name of Israel. They always devise new persecutions. They\\n  wish to bring you to the stake...Listen my brethren, to the counsel I will\\n  give you. I too was born in Germany and studied Torah with the German\\n  rabbis. I was driven out of my native country and came to the Turkish land,\\n  which is blessed by God and filled with all good things.

We possess great fortunes; much gold and silver in our hands. We are\\n  not oppressed with heavy taxes, and our commerce is free and unhindered.\\n  Rich are the fruits of the earth. Everything is cheap, and every one of us\\n  lives in peace and freedom. Here the Jew is not compelled to wear a yellow\\n  hat as a badge of shame, as is the case in Germany, where even wealth and\\n  great fortune are a curse for a Jew because he therewith arouses jealousy\\n  among the Christians and they devise all kinds of slander against him\\n  to rob him of his gold.

I consider 5\\' a reasonable space\\nlimitation, but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to\\nthose nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at\\nwhat distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the\\nendangerment of others, so we do a 5\\' restriction, or the possibility\\nof being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and\\ndraw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental\\nflaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing\\nthe responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.\\nPerhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault\\nrifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has\\nonly range and acurracy going for it.\\n\\n>They have determined that their lives are worth the effort to\\n>protect their homes and families. Using nuclear weapons close \\n>to home will not accomplish this.\\n\\n\\tI disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much\\nmore easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word\\nwould get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this\\nis not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change\\nquite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians\\nintent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The\\nbalancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.\\n\\n>There is, however, another problem: In any case of civil war,\\n>the strength of the militias fighting on each side should\\n>reflect the popular will.

With such low\\nnumbers, obviously due to cost, I don\\'t think the superior\\nweapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically\\nsuperior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training\\nincludes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,\\nwhereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.\\n\\n>I think it is vital to avoid such a situation, where a small \\n>minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power\\n>through violence. To prevent this, it may be necessary to give \\n>control of heavy weapons (e.g. those which only a small number\\n>of individuals would own _and_ whose firepower would grossly \\n>distort the relation between popular support and military \\n>strength) to someone other that individual militiamen. This is\\n>certainly not a good thing, but I think it is the lesser of two evils.\\n>Whoever controls these weapons must be a democratic body,\\n>responsive to the will of the people.\\n\\n\\tI had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers\\nof a select group, and the like would exercise control over the\\nheavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman\\ntank I certainly wouldn\\'t ask him to give it up.  Follow orders\\nfrom the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,\\nthough, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should\\ntherefore be jointly maintained and operated.\\n\\n>Here, I think we have to be carefull about _which_ \"state\" we\\n>are talking about: Certainly one role of the militia is to\\n>overthrow a repressive government, and it would be completely\\n>destructive to that end for that same government to control \\n>the militia\\'s arms. But the United States have several levels\\n>of government, each able to act independently, but not all\\n>likely targets of rebelion.\\n>As such, rebelions against state and\\n>local governments are very unlikely. I think, therefore, that the\\n>state (or possibly local) governments could safely be allowed to\\n>keep the select militia\\'s heavy weapons. The risk of abuse, while\\n>still something to consider, is far less than the similar risk\\n>were the federal government in control.\\n\\n\\tThis I\\'ll agree with to a point.  The State having control\\nover the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state\\nto have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that\\nthe ability of the State to lock them up isn\\'t so easy.  Otherwise,\\nI would have to assume that State control would rest on the\\nauthority of the Governor and militia officers.\\n\\n>That is eaxctly why I think they should be removed: The select\\n>militia should privide the militia\\'s heavy weapons and highly-trained\\n>specialists. For the reasons I have outlines above, I think \\n>these heavy weapons (tanks, artillery, aircraft, etc...) are\\n>better off being kept by local governments than by a small \\n>number of individuals. However, local governments shouldn\\'t\\n>be able to use the select militia without the support to the\\n>people. Ideally, the general militia, under the direct \\n>control of the people, and the select militia, under the direction\\n>of democratic, local governments, would opperate together.\\n>But even in the worst case, the general militia should be able\\n>to functional without the select militia. Similarly, the\\n>select militia should be incapable of action without the\\n>aid of the general militia.\\n\\n\\tI\\'m having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,\\nfairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few\\npeople with government support.  Just as you argued above that\\nthe weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control\\nso one side doesn\\'t have all of them, I can\\'t see where this\\nsituation is alleviated in having the select militia holding\\nall the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.\\nI think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that\\nthe Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the\\nunorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.\\n\\n>Consider, then, the effect of removing the National Guard\\'s\\n>infantry and placing the Guard under the control of local\\n>governments.

These would be much more useful to infantry than the\\ntank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.\\nI suppose I\\'m quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.\\n\\n>>...but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds\\n>>dikes in times of flood, sets up disaster relief cities, and\\n>>the like.\\n>\\n>I would much rather see these things handled by the local, \\n>general militias.\\n\\n\\tSo would I, but the resources often aren\\'t available to\\noutfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to\\ncall in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster\\nthan anything else.\\n\\n>Perhaps the National Guard isn\\'t as close to my conception of\\n>the select militia as I thought: I was considering them to \\n>be the heavy weapons/armor arm of the militia, not the infantry\\n>arm of the regular army.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think\\nmain battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up\\nfield pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton\\ntrucks, HumVee\\'s, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff\\nof a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units\\nin Iowa are currently fielding in some units.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy\\nequipment under State control, with little but numbers and light\\nstuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the\\nstates should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local\\nranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,\\nhence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,\\nthe militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for\\nother responses.  The Federal army, I\\'m convinced, should have a\\nvery minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias\\nfor these functions.\\n\\n< Dan Sorenson, DoD #1066 z1dan@exnet.iastate.edu viking@iastate.edu >\\n<  ISU only censors what I read, not what I say.

On the\\nother hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can\\'t even get\\n90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.\\n\\n(By the way, don\\'t get me wrong -- I like Jagr.

Hamas figures\\nsignificantly in the Middle East equation. In December, Israel\\ndeported more than 400 Palestinians to Lebanon in response to\\nHamas\\'s kidnapping and execution of an Israeli soldier. A longer\\nversion appears in the May issue of Harper\\'s Magazine, which\\nobtained and translated the tape.)\\n \\n     My name is Yasir Hammad al-Hassan Ali. I live in Nuseirat [a\\nrefugee camp in the Gaza Strip]. I was born in 1964. I finished\\nhigh school, then attended Gaza Polytechnic. Later, I went to work\\nfor Islamic University in Gaza as a clerk. I\\'m married and I have\\ntwo daughters.\\n     The Qassam Battalions are the only group in Palestine\\nexplicitly dedicated to jihad [holy war]. Our primary concern is\\nPalestinians who collaborate with the enemy. Many young men and\\nwomen have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the [Israeli]\\nSecurity Services.\\n     Since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation,\\ncooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime. Our most\\nimportant objective must be to put an end to the plague of\\ncollaboration. To do so, we abduct collaborators, intimidate and\\ninterrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose\\nthe methods that the enemy uses to lure Palestinians into\\ncollaboration in the first place. In addition to that, naturally,\\nwe confront the problem of collaborators by executing them.\\n     We don\\'t execute every collaborator. After all, about 70\\npercent of them are innocent victims, tricked or black-mailed into\\ntheir misdeeds. The decision whether to execute a collaborator is\\nbased on the seriousness of his crimes. If, like many\\ncollaborators, he has been recruited as an agent of the Israeli\\nBorder Guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once.\\nHe\\'s as dangerous as an Israeli soldier, so we treat him like an\\nIsraeli soldier.\\n     There\\'s another group of collaborators who perform an even\\nmore loathsome role -- the ones who help the enemy trap young men\\nand women in blackmail schemes that force them to become\\ncollaborators. I regard the \"isqat\" [the process by which a\\nPalestinians is blackmailed into collaboration] of single person as\\ngreater crime than the killing of a demonstrator. If someone is\\nguilty of causing repeated cases of isqat, than it is our religious\\nduty to execute him.\\n     A third group of collaborators is responsible for the\\ndistribution of narcotics. They work on direct orders from the\\nSecurity Services to distribute drugs as widely as possible. Their\\nvictims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and\\nimpossible to afford more. They collaborate in order to get the\\ndrugs they crave. The dealers must also be executed.\\n     In the battalions, we have developed a very careful method of\\nuncovering collaborators, We can\\'t afford to abduct an innocent\\nperson, because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished\\nforever. We will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after\\nevidence of his guilt has been established -- never before. If\\nafter interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any\\ndoubt, then he is executed.\\n     In many cases, we don\\'t have to make our evidence against\\ncollaborators public, because everyone knows that they\\'re guilty.\\nBut when the public isn\\'t aware that a certain individual is a\\ncollaborator, and we accuse him, people are bound to ask for\\nevidence. Many people will proclaim his innocence, so there must be\\nirrefutable proof before he is executed. This proof is usually\\nobtained in the form of a confession.\\n     At first, every collaborator denies his crimes. So we start\\noff by showing the collaborator the testimony against him. We tell\\nhim that he still has a chance to serve his people, even in the\\nlast moment of his life, by confessing and giving us the\\ninformation we need.\\n     We say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has\\nbeen a victim. That kind of talk is convincing. Most of them\\nconfess after that. Others hold out; in those cases, we apply\\npressure, both psychological and physical. Then the holdouts\\nconfess as well.\\n     Only one collaborator has ever been executed without an\\ninterrogation. In that case, the collaborator had been seen working\\nfor the Border Guard since before the intifada, and he himself\\nconfessed his involvement to a friend, who disclosed the\\ninformation to us. In addition, three members of his network of\\ncollaborators told us that he had caused their isqat. With this\\nmuch evidence, there was no need to interrogate him. But we are\\nvery careful to avoid wrongful executions. In every case, our\\nprincipal is the same: the accused should be interrogated until he\\nhimself confesses his crimes. \\n     A few weeks ago, we sat down and complied a list of\\ncollaborators to decide whether there were any who could be\\nexecuted without interrogation. An although we had hundreds of\\nnames, still, because of our fear of God and of hell, we could not\\nmark any of these men, except for the one I just mentioned, for\\nexecution.\\n     When we execute a collaborator in public, we use a gun. But\\nafter we abduct and interrogate a collaborator, we can\\'t shoot him\\n-- to do so might give away our locations. That\\'s why collaborators\\nare strangled. Sometimes we ask the collaborator, \"What do you\\nthink? How should we execute you?\" One collaborator told us,\\n\"Strangle me.\" He hated the sight of blood.\\n\\n-----\\nNaftaly Stramer \\t\\t\\t | Intergraph Electronics\\nInternet: nstramer@dazixco.ingr.com      | 6101 Lookout Road, Suite A    \\nVoice: (303)581-2370  FAX: (303)581-9972 | Boulder, CO 80301\\n\"Quality is everybody\\'s job, and it\\'s everybody\\'s job to watch all that they can.\"\\n',\n",

We paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates--the\\nprice was too great! Now, after the Sumgait tragedy, we, the victims, divide\\nour lives into \"before\" and \\'\\'after.\" We talk like that: that was before the\\nwar. Like the people who went through World War II and considered it a whole\\nepoch, a fate. No matter how many years go by, no matter how long we live,\\nit will never be forgotten. On the contrary, some of the moments become even \\nsharper: in our rage, in our sorrow, we saw everything differently, but now\\n. . . They say that you can see more with distance, and we can see those\\ninhuman events with more clarity now . . . we more acutely perceive our\\nlosses and everything that happened.\\n\\nNineteen eighty-eight was a leap year. Everyone fears a leap year and wants it\\nto pass as quickly as possible. Yet we never thought that that leap year would\\nbe such a black one for every Sumgait Armenian: those who lost someone and \\nthose who didn\\'t.\\n\\nThat second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family, although you \\ncould already smell danger in the air. But we didn\\'t think that the danger was\\nnear and possible, so we didn\\'t take any steps to save ourselves. At least, as\\nmy parents say, at least we should have done something to save the children. \\nMy parents themselves are not that old, 52 and 53 years. But then they thought\\nthat they had already lived enough, and did everything they could to save us.\\n\\nIn our apartment the tragedy started on February 28, around five in the\\nafternoon. I call it a tragedy, and I repeat: it was a tragedy even though all\\nour family survived. When I recall how they broke down our door my skin\\ncrawls; even now, among Armenians, among people who wish me only well, I feel\\nlike it\\'s all starting over again. I remember how that mob broke into our \\napartment . . . My parents were standing in the hall. My father had an axe in \\nhis hands and had immediately locked both of the doors. Our door was rarely \\nlocked since friends and neighbors often dropped by. We\\'re known as a \\nhospitable family, and we just never really thought about whether the people \\nwho were coming to see us were Azerbaijanis, Jews, or Russians. We had friends\\nof many nationalities, even a Turkmen woman.\\n\\nMy parents were in the hall, my father with an axe. I remember him telling my \\nmother, \"Run to the kitchen for a knife.\" But Mother was detached, pale, as \\nthough she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer. To be honest I never \\nexpected it of her, she\\'s afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark. A \\ngirlfriend was at the house that day, a Russian girl, Lyuda, and Mamma said, \\n\"No matter what happens, no matter what they do to us, you\\'re not to come out \\nof the bedroom. We\\'re going to tell them that we\\'re alone in the apartment.\"\\n\\nWe went into the bedroom. There were four of us. Marina and the Russian girl \\ncrawled under the bed, and we covered them up with a rug, boxes of dishes, and\\nKarina and I are standing there and looking at one another. The idea that \\nperhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside \\nme. I\\'m an emotional person and I express my emotions immediately. I wanted to\\nembrace her and kiss her, as though it were the last second. And maybe Karina \\nwas thinking the same thing, but she\\'s quite reserved. We didn\\'t have time to \\nsay anything to each other because we immediately heard Mamma raise a shout. \\nThere was so much noise from the tramping of feet, from the shouting, and from\\nexcited voices. I couldn\\'t figure what was going on out there because the door\\nto the bedroom was only open a crack. But when Mamma shouted the second time\\nKarina ran out of the bedroom. I ran after her, I had wanted to hold her back,\\nbut when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us \\nimmediately. The only thing I managed to do was close the door behind me, at \\nleast so as to save Marina and her friend. The mob was shouting, all of their \\neyes were shining, all red, like from insomnia. At first about 40 people burst\\nin, but later I was standing with my back to the door and couldn\\'t see. They \\ncame into the hall, into the kitchen, and dragged my father into the other \\nroom. He didn\\'t utter a word, he just raised the axe to hit them, but Mamma \\nsnatched the axe from behind and said, \"Tell them not to touch the children. \\nTell them they can do as they want with us, but not to harm the children.\" She\\nsaid this to Father in Armenian.\\n\\nThere were Azerbaijanis from Armenia among the mob who broke in. They \\nunderstood Armenian perfectly. The local Azerbaijanis don\\'t know Armenian, \\nthey don\\'t need to speak it. And one of them responded in Armenian: \"You and \\nyour children both . . . we\\'re going to do the same thing to you and your \\nchildren that you Armenians did in Kafan. They killed our women, our girls, \\nour mothers, they cut their breasts off, and burned our houses . . . ,\" and \\nso on and so forth, \"and we came to do the same thing to you.\" This whole time\\nsome of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us. They \\nwere mostly young people, under 30. At first there weren\\'t any older people \\namong them. And all of their faces were unfamiliar. Sumgait is a small town, \\nall the same, and we know a lot of people by their faces, especially me, I\\'m \\na teacher.\\n\\nSo they dragged my father into the other room. They twisted his arms and took \\nhim in there, no they didn\\'t take him in there, they dragged him in there,\\nbecause he was already unable to walk. They closed the door to that room all \\nbut a crack. We couldn\\'t see what was happening to Father, what they were \\ndoing to him. Then a young man, about 26 years old, started to tear off \\nMamma\\'s sarafan, and Mamma shouted at him in Azerbaijani: \"I\\'m old enough to \\nbe your mother! What are you doing?!\" He struck her. Now he\\'s being held, \\nMamma identified him. I hope he\\'s convicted. Then they went after Karina, \\nwho\\'s been talking to them like a Komsomol leader, as though she were trying \\nto lead them down a different path, as they say, to influence their \\nconsciousness. She told them that what they were doing was wrong, that they \\nmustn\\'t do it. She said, \"Come on, let\\'s straighten this out, without \\nemotions. What do you want? Who are you? Why did you come here? What did we \\never do to you?\" Someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come \\ninto our home, but then the ones in the back--more of them kept coming and \\ncoming--said, \"What are you talking to, them for. You should kill them. We \\ncame here to kill them.\"\\n\\nThey pushed Karina, struck her, and she fell down. They beat her, but she \\ndidn\\'t cry out. Even when they tore her clothes off, she kept repeating, \"What\\ndid we do to you? What did we do to you?\" And even later, when she came to, \\nshe said, \"Mamma, what did we do to them? Why did they do that to us?\"\\n\\nThat group was prepared, I know this because I noticed that some of them only \\nbroke up furniture, and others only dealt with us. I remember that when they \\nwere beating me, when they were tearing my clothes off, I felt neither pain \\nnor shame because my entire attention was riveted to Karina. All I could do \\nwas watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her, and what they\\ndid to her. That\\'s why I felt no pain. Later, when they carried Karina off, \\nthey beat her savagely . . . It\\'s really amazing that she not only lived, but \\ndidn\\'t lose her mind . She is very beautiful and they did everything they \\ncould to destroy her beauty. Mostly they beat her face, with their fists, \\nkicking her, using anything they could find.\\n\\nMamma, Karina, and I were all in one room. And again I didn\\'t feel any pain, \\njust didn\\'t feel any, no matter how much they beat me, no matter what they \\ndid. Then one of those creeps said that there wasn\\'t enough room in the\\napartment. They broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the \\ncorners so there would be more room. Then someone suggested, \"Let\\'s take her \\noutside.\"\\n\\nThose beasts were in Heaven. They did what they would do every day if they \\nweren\\'t afraid of the authorities. Those were their true colors. At the time \\nI thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren\\'t \\nafraid of what would happen to them.\\n\\nWhen they carried Karina out and beat Mamma-her face was completely covered \\nwith blood--that\\'s when I started to feel the pain. I blacked out several \\ntimes from the pain, but each moment that I had my eyes open it was as though \\nI were recording it all on film. I think I\\'m a kind person by nature, but I\\'m \\nvengeful, especially if someone is mean to me, and I don\\'t deserve it. I hold \\na grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain. And every time \\nI would come to and see one of those animals on top of me, I\\'d remember them, \\nand I\\'ll remember them for the rest of my life, even though people tell me \\n\"forget,\" you have to forget, you have to go on living.\\n\\nAt some point I remember that they stood me up and told me something, and \\ndespite the fact that I hurt all over--I had been beaten terribly--I found\\nthe strength in myself to interfere with their tortures. I realized that I had\\nto do something: resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering \\nto an end. I pushed one of them away, he was a real horse. I remember now that\\nhe\\'s being held, too. As though they were all waiting for it, they seized me\\nand took me out onto the balcony. I had long hair, and it was stuck all over\\nme. One of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open, and I realized that\\nthey planned to throw me out the window, because they had already picked me up\\nwith their hands, I was up in the air. As though for the last time I took a \\nreally deep breath and closed my eyes, and somehow braced myself inside, I \\nsuddenly became cold, as though my heart had sunk into my feet. And suddenly \\nI felt myself flying. I couldn\\'t figure out if I was really flying or if I \\njust imagined it. When I came to I thought now I\\'m going to smash on the \\nground. And when it didn\\'t happen I opened my eyes and realized that I was \\nstill lying on the floor. And since I didn\\'t scream, didn\\'t beg them at all,\\nthey became all the more wild, like wolves. They started to trample me with\\ntheir feet. Shoes with heels on them, and iron horseshoes, like they had spe-\\ncially put them on. Then I lost consciousness.\\n\\nI came to a couple of times and waited for death, summoned it, beseeched it. \\nSome people ask for good health, life, happiness, but at that moment I didn\\'t \\nneed any of those things. I was sure that none of us would survive, and I had \\neven forgotten about Marina; and if none of us was alive, it wasn\\'t worth \\nliving.\\n\\nThere was a moment when the pain was especially great. I withstood inhuman \\npain, and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come \\nbecause I had showed myself to be so tenacious. I started to strangle myself, \\nand when I started to wheeze they realized that with my death I was going to\\nput an end to their pleasures, and they pulled my hands from my throat. The \\nperson who injured and insulted me most painfully I remember him very well, \\nbecause he was the oldest in the group. He looked around 48. I know that he \\nhas four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person, \\none who would never do such a thing. Something came over him then, you see, \\neven during the investigation he almost called me \"daughter,\" he apologized, \\nalthough, of course, he knew that I\\'d never forgive him. Something like that \\nI can never forgive. I have never injured anyone with my behavior, with my \\nwords, or with my deeds, I have always put myself in the other person\\'s shoes,\\nbut then, in a matter of hours, they trampled me entirely. I shall never \\nforget it.\\n\\nI wanted to do myself in then, because I had nothing to lose, because no one \\ncould protect me. My father, who tried to do something against that hoard of \\nbeasts by himself, could do nothing and wouldn\\'t be able to do anything.\\nI knew that I was even sure that he was no longer alive.\\n\\nAnd Ira Melkumian, my acquaintance I knew her and had been to see her family a\\ncouple of times--her brother tried to save her and couldn\\'t, so he tried to \\nkill her, his very own sister. He threw an axe at her to kill her and put an \\nend to her suffering. When they stripped her clothes off and carried her into \\nthe other room, her brother knew what awaited her. I don\\'t know which one it \\nwas, Edik or Igor. Both of them were in the room from which the axe was \\nthrown. But the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her \\nand made her death even more excruciating, maybe the most excruciating of all \\nthe deaths of those days in Sumgait. I heard about it all from the neighbor \\nfrom the Melkumians\\' landing. His name is Makhaddin, he knows my family a \\nlittle. He came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in Baku,\\nhow we were feeling, and if we needed anything. He\\'s a good person. He said, \\n\"You should praise God that you all survived. But what I saw with my own eyes,\\nI, a man, who has seen so many people die, who has lived a whole life, I,\" he\\nsays, \"nearly lost my mind that day. I had never seen the likes of it and \\nthink I never shall again.\" The door to his apartment was open and he saw \\neverything. One of the brothers threw the axe, because they had already taken \\nthe father and mother out of the apartment. Igor, Edik, and Ira remained. He \\nsaw Ira, naked, being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven\\npeople. He told us about it and said he would never forget it. He heard the \\nbrothers shouting something, inarticulate from pain, rage, and the fact that \\nthey were powerless to do anything. But all the same they tried to \\ndo something. The guy who got hit with the axe lived.                                                                           I     I\\n\\nAfter I had been unsuccessful at killing myself I saw them taking Marina and \\nLyuda out of the bedroom. I was in such a state that I couldn\\'t even \\nremember my sister\\'s name. I wanted to cry \"Marina!\" out to her, but could\\nnot. I looked at her and knew that it was a familiar, dear face, but couldn\\'t\\nfor the life of me remember what her name was and who she was. And thus\\nI saved her, because when they were taking her out, she, as it turns out, had\\ntold them that she had just been visiting and that she and Lyuda were both\\nthere by chance, that they weren\\'t Armenians. Lyuda\\'s a Russian, you can tell \\nright away, and Marina speaks Azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that\\nshe was an Azerbaijani. And I almost gave her away and doomed her. I\\'m glad \\nthat at least Marina came out of this all in good physical health . . . \\nalthough her spirit was murdered . . .\\n\\nAt some point I came to and saw Igor, Igor Agayev, my acquaintance, in that \\nmob. He lives in the neighboring building. For some reason I remembered his \\nname, maybe I sensed my defense in him. I called out to him in Russian, \"Igor,\\nhelp!\" But he turned away and went into the bedroom. Just then they were \\ntaking Marina and Lyuda out of the bedroom. Igor said he knew Marina and \\nLyuda, that Marina in fact was Azerbaijani, and he took both of them to the \\nneighbors.\\n\\nAnd the idea stole through me that maybe Igor had led them to our apartment, \\nsomething like that, but if he was my friend, he was supposed to save me.\\n \\nThen they were striking me very hard--we have an Indian vase, a metal one, \\nthey were hitting me on the back with it and I blacked out--they took me out \\nonto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window. They were already \\nsure that I was dead because I didn\\'t react at all to the new blows. Someone \\nsaid, \"She\\'s already dead, let\\'s throw her out.\" When they carried me out onto\\nthe balcony for the second time, when I was about to die the second time, I \\nheard someone say in Azerbaijani: \"Don\\'t kill her, I know her, she\\'s a \\nteacher.\" I can still hear that voice ringing in my ears, but I can\\'t remember\\nwhose voice it was. It wasn\\'t Igor, because he speaks Azerbaijani with an \\naccent: his mother is Russian and they speak Russian at home. He speaks\\nAzerbaijani worse than our Marina does. I remember when they carried me in and\\nthrew me on the bed he came up to me, that person, and \\tI having opened my \\neyes, saw and recognized that person, but immediately passed out cold. I had \\nbeen beaten so much that I didn\\'t have the strength to remember him. I only \\nremember that this person was older and he had a high position. Unfortunately \\nI can\\'t remember anything more.\\n\\nWhat should I say about Igor? He didn\\'t treat me badly. I had heard a lot \\nabout him, that he wasn\\'t that good a person, that he sometimes drank too\\nmuch. Once he boasted to me that he had served in Afghanistan. He knew that \\nwomen usually like bravery in a man. Especially if a man was in Afghanistan,\\nif he was wounded, then it\\'s about eighty percent sure that he will be treated\\nvery sympathetically, with respect. Later I found out that he had served in \\nUfa, and was injured, but that\\'s not in Afghanistan, of course. I found that \\nall out later.\\n\\nAmong the people who were in our apartment, my Karina also saw the Secretary \\nof the Party organization. I don\\'t know his last name, his first name is \\nNajaf, he is an Armenian-born Azerbaijani. But later Karina wasn\\'t so sure,\\nshe was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw, and she \\ndidn\\'t want to endanger him. She said, \"He was there,\" and a little while \\nlater, \"Maybe they beat me so much that I am confusing him with someone else. \\nNo, it seems like it was he.\" I am sure it was he because when he came to see \\nus the first time he said one thing, and the next time he said something \\nentirely different. The investigators haven\\'t summoned him yet. He came to see\\nus in the Khimik boarding house where we were living at the time. He brought \\ngroceries and flowers, this was right before March 8th; he almost started \\ncrying, he was so upset to see our condition. I don\\'t know if he was putting \\nus on or not, but later, after we had told the investigator and they summoned \\nhim to the Procuracy, he said that he had been in Baku, he wasn\\'t in Sumgait. \\nThe fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that Karina is \\nright, that in fact it was he who was in our apartment. I don\\'t know how the \\ninvestigators are now treating him. At one point I wondered and asked, and was\\ntold that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment. Couldn\\'t he have gone \\nto Baku and arranged an alibi? I\\'m not ruling out that possibility.\\n\\nIll now return to our apartment. Mamma had come to. You could say that she \\nbought them off with the gold Father gave her when they were married: her \\nwedding band and her watch were gold. She bought her own and her husband\\'s \\nlives with them. She gave the gold to a 14-year old boy. Vadim Vorobyev. A \\nRussian boy, he speaks Azerbaijani perfectly. He\\'s an orphan who was raised by\\nhis grandfather and who lives in Sumgait on Nizami Street. He goes to a \\nspecial school, one for mentally handicapped children. But I\\'ll say this--I\\'m \\na teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes I can form an opinion--that\\nboy is not at all mentally handicapped. He\\'s healthy, he can think just fine, \\nand analyze, too . . . policemen should be so lucky. And he\\'s cunning, too. \\nAfter that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album.\\n\\nHe beat Mamma and demanded gold, saying, \"Lady, if you give us all the gold \\nand money in your apartment we\\'ll let you live.\" And Mamma told them where \\nthe gold was. He brought in the bag and opened it, shook out the contents, and \\neveryone who was in the apartment jumped on it, started knocking each other \\nover and taking the gold from one another. I\\'m surprised they didn\\'t kill one \\nanother right then.\\n\\nMamma was still in control of herself. She had been beaten up, her face was\\nblack and blue from the blows, and her eyes were filled with blood, and she \\nran into the other room. Father was lying there, tied up, with a gag in his\\nmouth and a pillow over his face. There was a broken table on top of the pil-\\nlow. Mamma grabbed Father and he couldn\\'t walk; like me, he was half dead, \\nhalfway into the other world. He couldn\\'t comprehend anything, couldn\\'t see, \\nand was covered with black and blue. Mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth, \\nit was some sort of cloth, I think it was a slipcover from an armchair.\\n\\nThe bandits were still in our apartment, even in the room Mamma pulled Father \\nout of, led him out of, carried him out of. We had two armchairs in that room,\\na small magazine table, a couch, a television, and a screen. Three people \\nwere standing next to that screen, and into their shirts, their pants, \\neverywhere imaginable, they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee\\nservice--Mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye. She said, \"I was afraid \\nto turn around, I just seized Father and started pulling him, but at the \\nthreshold I couldn\\'t hold him up, he fell down, and I picked him up again and \\ndragged him down the stairs to the neighbors\\'.\" Mamma remembered one of the \\ncriminals, the one who had watched her with his face half-turned toward her, \\nout of one eye. She says, \"I realized that my death would come from that \\nperson. I looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing.\"\\nLater they caught that scoundrel. Meanwhile, Mamma grabbed Father and left.\\n\\nI was alone. Igor had taken Marina away, Mamma and Father were gone, Karina \\nwas already outside, I didn\\'t know what they were doing to her. I was left all\\nalone, and at that moment . . . I became someone else, do you understand? Even\\nthough I knew that neither Mother and Father in the other room, nor Marina and\\nLyuda under the bed could save me, all the same I somehow managed to hold out.\\nI went on fighting them, I bit someone, I remember, and I scratched another. \\nBut when I was left alone I realized what kind of people they were, the ones \\nI had observed, the ones who beat Karina, what kind of people they were, the \\nones who beat me, that it was all unnecessary, that I was about to die and \\nthat all of that would die with me.\\n\\nAt some point I took heart when I saw the young man from the next building. I \\ndidn\\'t know his name, but we would greet one another when we met, we knew that\\nwe were from the same microdistrict. When I saw him I said, \"Neighbor, is that\\nyou?\" In so doing I placed myself in great danger. He realized that if I lived\\nI would remember him. That\\'s when he grabbed the axe. The axe that had been \\ntaken from my father. I automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to \\ntake the blow of the axe, although at the time it would have been better if he\\nhad struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery. When he \\nstarted getting ready to wind back for the blow, someone came into the room. \\nThe newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor\\'s axe froze in \\nthe air. Everyone stood at attention for this guy, like soldiers in the \\npresence of a general. Everyone waited for his word: continue the atrocities \\nor not. He said, \"Enough, let\\'s go to the third entryway.\" In the third \\nentryway they killed Uncle Shurik, Aleksandr Gambarian. This confirms once \\nagain that they had prepared in advance. Almost all of them left with him, as \\nthey went picking up pillows, blankets, whatever they needed, whatever they \\nfound, all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot, someone else had \\nalready taken the other.\\n\\nFour people remained in the room, soldiers who didn\\'t obey their general. They\\nhad to have come recently, because other faces had flashed in front of me over\\nthose 2 to 3 hours, but I had never seen those three. One of them, Kuliyev (I \\nidentified him later), a native of the Sisian District of Armenia, an \\nAzerbaijani, had moved to Azerbaijan a year before. He told me in Armenian:\\n\"Sister, don\\'t be afraid, I\\'ll drive those three Azerbaijanis out of here.\"\\nThat\\'s just what he said, \"those Azerbaijanis,\" as though he himself were not \\nAzerbaijani, but some other nationality, he said with such hatred, \"I\\'ll drive\\nthem out of here now, and you put your clothes on, and find a hammer and nails\\nand nail the door shut, because they\\'ll be coming back from Apartment 41.\" \\nThat\\'s when I found out that they had gone to Apartment 41. Before that, the \\nperson in the Eskimo dogskin coat, the one who came in and whom they listened \\nto, the \"general,\" said that they were going to the third entryway.\\n\\nKuliyev helped me get some clothes on, because l couldn\\'t do it by myself. \\nMarina\\'s old fur coat was lying on the floor. He threw it over my shoulders, I\\nwas racked with shivers, and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer. \\nHe wanted to give them to me so that when he left I could nail the door shut. \\nBut the door was lying on the floor in the hall.\\n\\nI went out onto the balcony. There were broken windows, and flowers and dirt \\nfrom flowerpots were scattered on the floor. It was impossible to find \\nanything. He told me, \"Well, fine, I won\\'t leave you here. Would any of the \\nneighbors let you in? They\\'ll be back, they won\\'t calm down, they know you\\'re \\nalive.\" He told me all this in Armenian.\\n\\nThen he returned to the others and said, \"What are you waiting for? Leave!\" \\nThey said, \"Ah, you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her \\nyourself. No, we want to do it to.\" He urged them on, but gently, not \\ncoarsely, because he was alone against them, although they were still just\\nboys, not old enough to be drafted. He led them out of the room, and went\\ndown to the third floor with them himself, and said, \"Leave. What\\'s the mat-\\nter, aren\\'t you men? Go fight with the men. What do you want of her?\" And\\nhe came back upstairs. They wanted to come up after him and he realized that \\nhe couldn\\'t hold them off forever. Then he asked me where he could hide me. I \\ntold him at the neighbors\\' on the fourth floor, Apartment 10, we were on really\\ngood terms with them.\\n\\nWe knocked on the door, and he explained in Azerbaijani. The neighbor woman \\nopened the door and immediately said, \"I\\'m an Azerbaijani.\" He said, \"I know. \\nLet her sit at your place a while. Don\\'t open the door to anyone, no one knows\\nabout this, I won\\'t tell anyone. Let her stay at your place.\" She says, \"Fine,\\nhave her come in.\" I went in. She cried a bit and gave me some stockings, I \\nhad gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders. I burst into \\ntears. Even though I was wearing Marina\\'s old fur coat, it\\'s a short one, a \\nhalf-length, I was cold all the same. I asked, \"Do you know where my family \\nis, what happened to them?\" She says, \"No, I don\\'t know anything. I\\'m afraid \\nto go out of the apartment, now they\\'re so wild that they don\\'t look to see \\nwho\\'s Azerbaijani and who\\'s Armenian.\" Kuliyev left. Ten minutes later my \\nneighbor says, \"You know, Lyuda, I don\\'t want to lose my life because of you, \\nor my son and his wife. Go stay with someone else.\" During the butchery in our\\napartment one of the scum, a sadist, took my earring in his mouth--I had pearl\\nearrings on--and ripped it out, tearing the earlobe. The other earring was \\nstill there. When I\\'m nervous I fix my hair constantly, and then, when I \\ntouched my ear, I noticed that I had one earring on. I took it out and gave it\\nto her. She took the earring, but she led me out of the apartment.\\n\\nI went out and didn\\'t know where to go. I heard someone going upstairs. I \\ndon\\'t know who it was but assumed it was them. With tremendous difficulty I \\nend up to our apartment, I wanted to die in my own home. I go into the \\napartment and hear that they are coming up to our place, to the fifth floor. \\nI had to do something. I went into the bedroom where Marina and Lyuda had \\nhidden and saw that the bed was overturned. Instead of hiding I squatted near \\nsome broken Christmas ornaments, found an unbroken one, and started sobbing. \\nThen they came in. Someone said that there were still some things to take. I \\nthink that someone pushed me under the bed. I lay on the floor, and there were\\nbroken ornaments on it, under my head and legs. I got all cut up, but I lay \\nthere without moving. My heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town \\ncould hear it. There were no lights on. Maybe that\\'s what saved me. They were \\nburning matches, and toward the end they brought in a candle. They started\\npicking out the clothes that could still be worn. They took Father\\'s sport \\njacket and a bedspread, the end of which was under my head. They pulled on the\\none end, and it felt like they were pulling my hair out. I almost cried out. \\nAnd again I realized I wasn\\'t getting out of there alive, and I started to \\nstrangle myself again. I took my throat in one hand, and pressed the other on \\nmy mouth, so as not to wheeze, so that I would die and they would only find me\\nafterward. They were throwing the burned matches under the bed, and I got \\nburned, but I withstood it. Something inside of me held on, someone\\'s hand was\\nprotecting me to the end. I knew that I was going to die, but I didn\\'t know \\nhow. I knew that if I survived I would walk out of that apartment, but if \\nI found out that one of my family had died, I would die for sure, because I \\nhad never been so close to death and couldn\\'t imagine how you could go on \\nliving without your mother or father, or without your sister. Marina, I \\nthought, was still alive: she went to Lyuda\\'s place or someone is hiding her. \\nI tried to think that Igor wouldn\\'t let them be killed. He served in \\nAfghanistan, he should protect her.\\n\\nWhile I was strangling myself I said my good-byes to everyone. And then I\\nthought, how could Marina survive alone. If they killed all of us, how would \\nshe live all by herself? There were six people in the room. They talked among \\nthemselves and smoked. One talked about his daughter, saying that there was no\\nchildren\\'s footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter. \\nAnother said that he liked the apartment--recently we had done a really good \\njob fixing everything up--and that he would live there after everything was \\nall over. They started to argue. A third one says, \"How come you get it? I \\nhave four children, and there are three rooms here, that\\'s just what I need. \\nAll these years I\\'ve been living in God-awful places.\" Another one says, \\n\"Neither of you gets it. We\\'ll set fire to it and leave.\" Then someone said \\nthat Azerbaijanis live right next door, the fire could move over to their\\nplace. And they, to my good fortune, didn\\'t set fire to the apartment, and\\nleft.\\n\\nOh, yes, I just remembered. While they were raping me they repeated quite \\nfrequently, \"Let the Armenian women have babies for us, Muslim babies, let \\nthem bear Azerbaijanis for the struggle against the Armenians.\" Then they \\nsaid, \"Those Muslims can carry on our holy cause. Heroes!\" They repeated it \\nvery often.\\n\\n\\t\\t     - - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

If I forgot or botched your\\nfavorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there\\'s an acronym *not*\\non this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure\\nit out, I\\'ll add it to the list.\\n\\nNote that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*\\nacronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated\\nevery acronym I ever saw, I\\'d soon run out of disk space!  :-)\\n\\nThe list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All\\ncomments regarding it are welcome; I\\'m reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.\\n\\nNote that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you\\'re on your\\nown for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of\\nacronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that\\nare essentially always explained as they\\'re introduced are omitted.\\nFurther, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of\\nthe list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they\\'re simply\\ndifferent ways of referring to the same thing.\\n\\nThanks to everybody who\\'s sent suggestions since the first version of\\nthe list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),\\nwho is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in\\ncharacter than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),\\nwho is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and\\nterms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).\\n\\nSpecial thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA\\nReference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and\\nAssociated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly\\nmammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.\\n\\nSpecial Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program\\nwritten by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the\\nacronym list in an entertaining fashion.

I used to think pretty much the\\nsame thing, then I got \\'educated.\\'\\n\\nPeople do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how\\nquickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don\\'t understand that\\nit takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick\\n(within a minute or so) death.\\n\\nThe death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage\\npoints of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are\\n\\'try their luck\\' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly\\nonly in a single direction and it\\'s only advantage is that it is a\\nremote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a\\nspherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.\\n\\nMost people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by\\naccident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for\\na holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only\\nmoderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a\\nDRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out\\nof ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and\\nability of it\\'s wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and\\nstrong.  It\\'s interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks\\nused by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled\\nslashing attacks of novices.  I\\'ve talked to several well trained\\nmartial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up\\nagainst a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as\\nthe attacker.\\n\\nPracticing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing\\nwith knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a\\nknife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their\\nknife attacks in prison.\\n\\nIf you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize\\nthese facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is\\nthe knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced\\nattacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old\\nman with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about\\none and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking\\ncast managed it in two.  I\\'ve seen people close that distance and strike\\nin 1 second.  I\\'m old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3\\nseconds.  I\\'ve seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons\\nthat you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest\\nwith a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the\\npointed end.)\\n\\nAdd to this the \\'fact\\' that hand gun \\'stopping\\' power is largely a myth.\\nExcept in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that\\ndestroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve\\nseconds for a bullet wound to \\'take effect.\\'\\n\\nThis is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman\\nin L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That\\nlady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All\\nfour of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta\\ngirl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex\\nof her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and\\ndestroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball\\nsized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was\\nout of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight\\nmonths!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was\\non her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn\\'t think\\ncivilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.\\n\\nThe moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife\\nattacker, you\\'d better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good\\nalternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk\\n(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor\\nthem.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact\\nweapons.  The target is as large as the traditional \\'center of mass\\' and\\nis more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a\\ncaliber powerful enough to \\'do the job.\\'  Hot .38\\'s on up will usually\\ndo this.\\n\\nRemember folks, the idea isn\\'t to \\'take em with you\\' but for you to live\\nand them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason\\n\\'killing them\\' isn\\'t our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep\\nus alive.\\n\\nI don\\'t want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now\\nknow, I can\\'t rightly say I\\'d rather face a knife than an gun.  It would\\nhave to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I\\nWOULDN\\'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not\\nfear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen\\nbehind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do\\nwhatever it takes.\\n\\nRick.\\n',\n",

(Similarly, the\\n>desire to help Muslims being fought by Christians is also exactly the opposite\\n>of what that theory predicts.)\\n\\nYou continue to misunderstand.  I did not say the reason why people want to\\nintervene is because of racist (<- you seem to be overly fond of using this\\nword, btw.  I said the phenomenon was race-related, which is not the same as\\nracist.  Perhaps this distinction is too subtle for you to grasp) motives - I\\nsaid the attention and outrage at the entire Yugoslavian situation was a result\\nof it being 1) closer to home, 2) happening to people we can identify with, and\\n3) relentlessly harped on by the media.  I never said anything about which side\\nwould be preferred, which has a lot more to do with the presentation of the\\nconflict than any psychological factors.  I think there is no doubt that despite\\nthe fact we intervened in Somalia, the level of attention devoted to there was\\nconsiderably less than what is devoted to Bosnia, if the newspapers and tv news\\nI see are any guide.\\n\\n\\nDave\\n\\n',\n",

These aren\\'t, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term\\ndenotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The\\nrockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to\\ndistinguish them from (smaller) model rockets.

A \"D\"\\nengine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse.\\nAn \"F\" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a\\ndoubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size \"O\" are\\navailable pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are\\nshipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of\\nsize F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as\\ncontrolled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket\\nengines.

It is, however, closely regulated. In order to \\npurchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be\\none of the following:\\na) An employee of a government agency.\\nb) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.\\nc) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in\\nresearch or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: \\nThe Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.\\nMembers of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction\\nand flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.\\n\\nThe FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any \\norganization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions \\nto avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:\\n- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the\\nlocation, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. \\n- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft\\nwithin the operating radius around the launch site.\\n- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.\\n- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that\\nunmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.\\n\\nMost of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)\\nare held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the\\nwestern deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular\\nsince it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).\\n\\nThe two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members\\'\\nuse, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is\\nfrom 50 to 500 or more feet. \\n\\nBy the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an \"F\" motor are exempt from\\nmost Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart\\nC, for details.\\n\\nAs for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to\\n50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical\\nrocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,\\nor multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry\\neither a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches\\nin the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.\\n\\nCamera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.\\n\\n>And no, I\\'m not going to even think of buying one.

I \\n   suspect that this PR campaign against Iran will continue and\\n   perhaps intensify.\\n\\nWhy this increased pressure on Iran? A number of factors may have\\nbeen behind this. These include:\\n\\n1) The rise of Islamic movements in North-Africa and radical\\n   Hamas movement in the Israeli occupied territories. This\\n   movement is basically anti-western and is not necessarily\\n   fueled by Iran. The cause for accelerated pace of this \\n   movement is probably the Gulf War which sought to return\\n   colonial Shieks and Amirs to their throne in the name of\\n   democracy and freedom. Also, the obvious support of Algerian\\n   military coup against the democratically elected Algerian\\n   Islamic Front which clearly exposed the democracy myth.\\n   A further cause of this may be the daily broadcast of the news\\n   on the slaughter of Bosnian Moslems.\\n\\n2) Possible future implications of this movement in Saudi Arabia\\n   and other US client states and endangerment of the cheap oil\\n   sources from this region.\\n\\n3) A need to create an enemy as an excuse for huge defense\\n   expenditures. This has become necessary after the demise of\\n   Soveit Union.\\n\\nThe recent PR campaign against Iran, however, seems to be directed\\nfrom Israel rather than Washington. There is no fundamental conflict\\nof interest between Iran and the US and in my opinion, it is in the\\ninterest of both countries to affect reestablishment of normal\\nand friendly relations. This may have a moderating effect on the\\nrise of radical movements within the Islamic world and Iran .\\n\\n--jamshid\\n',\n",

It seems most\\n|> >state cops are.\\n\\nEvery city and suburban police officer I\\'ve seen around the Twin Cities in the\\nlast two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though\\nI haven\\'t seen any Glock\\'s). \\n\\nWith regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual\\nrantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I\\'d like to put my two\\ncents worth in.  While there\\'s nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a \\nlarge frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to\\nsemi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob\\'s (I know, some people can\\'t stand\\nhim and think he\\'s full of bull, but I think that in general his material is\\nvery valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something \\nlike that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto\\'s are different, and that\\n\"different is good\".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in \\nmore accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a\\ncertain \"propriatory nature\" of each gun that takes some familiarity to \\nlearn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar\\nwith different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least\\nslowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.\\n\\n|> \\n|> Define \"armed better\".

With a single hand you either\\npull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi\\nauto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.\\n\\n\\n|> - A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again\\n|>   to rotate to the next round.\\n\\nI\\'m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA\\nsemi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same\\nround - an advantage you don\\'t have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will\\nalways go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud\\nbut what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it\\'s very rare, but your round will\\nnow go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide\\non a misfire takes very little time.\\n\\n\\n|> - A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the\\n|>   hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an\\n|>   easy motion, even one handed.\\n\\nActually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not\\nnecessary or usually recommended.

Can be faster depending on users.\\n\\nThe best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed\\nloaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two\\nhanded job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that\\nwhile you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the\\ngun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always \\ntake more time.  You also don\\'t have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing\\na partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can\\nstill be used if needed later).  \\n\\n|> \\n|> - A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell\\n|>   first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often\\n|>   lost as you realize \"hey, it\\'s jammed!\" before starting to do anything\\n|>   about clearing it.\\n\\nYes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear\\nit.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire\\nwith factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto\\nbut even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).\\n\\n\\n|> - Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round\\n|>   and cock the hammer.

While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should\\nsay that this applies to all of the ones I\\'ve looked at.  For the DA semi\\'s it\\'s\\nno different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing\\npin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there\\'s no real advantage\\ncarrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed\\nof employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I\\'m\\nnot familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was\\ninitially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining\\nthe design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and \\nshooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in\\na thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.

Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design\\n    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.\\n\\n\\n    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into\\n    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20\\n    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas\\n    scintillation proportional counters.\\n\\n\\n    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint\\n    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian\\n    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini\\n    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.\\n    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA\\n    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon\\n    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an\\n    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens\\n    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours\\n    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the\\n    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter\\n    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan\\n    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and\\n    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the\\n    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn\\'s atmosphere,\\n    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn\\'s\\n    satellites, and characterize Titan\\'s atmosphere and surface.\\n\\n    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its\\n    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that\\n    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These\\n    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan\\'s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the\\n    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.\\n\\n    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the\\n    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of\\n    Saturn\\'s satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan\\n    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan\\n    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true\\n    nature of Saturn\\'s rings.\\n\\n\\t Key Scheduled Dates for the Cassini Mission (VVEJGA Trajectory)\\n\\t -------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\t   10/06/97 - Titan IV/Centaur Launch\\n\\t   04/21/98 - Venus 1 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/20/99 - Venus 2 Gravity Assist\\n\\t   08/16/99 - Earth Gravity Assist\\n\\t   12/30/00 - Jupiter Gravity Assist\\n\\t   06/25/04 - Saturn Arrival\\n\\t   01/09/05 - Titan Probe Release\\n\\t   01/30/05 - Titan Probe Entry\\n\\t   06/25/08 - End of Primary Mission\\n\\t    (Schedule last updated 7/22/92)\\n\\n\\n    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit.

The satellite also\\n    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.\\n\\n\\n    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over\\n    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields\\n    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for\\n    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.\\n\\n    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of\\n    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from\\n    that planet by sliding over Jupiter\\'s north pole in a gravity-assist\\n    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted\\n    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun\\'s south pole\\n    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its\\n    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that\\'s right, a solar-studies spacecraft\\n    that\\'s always further from the Sun than the Earth is!\\n\\n    While in Jupiter\\'s neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and\\n    radiation environment.

December 1992 Author: Avi Raz\\n\\nSubject: Torture\\n\\nTitle of article: Moderate physical pressure\\n\\nSeveral times in the course of the long hours in the interrogation\\nroom in Tulkarm prison, during which he says he was humiliated,\\nbeaten and tortured, Omar Daoud Jaber heard his interrogator, a\\nShabak agent \\'Captain Louis\\', chatting on the phone with his wife.\\n\"At those moments\", Omar said, \"I felt that he was like a\\nhumanbeing, but right after he finished talking, he would be beat\\nme and say, \\'You listened to the conversation and enjoyed\\nyourself\\' and I understood that he was not really a human being\".\\n\\nIn late October 1992, after 38 days in detention at Tulkarm\\nprison, Omar Jaber was released without charges. \"Among the Jews,\\nas among the Arabs, there are good people and bad people\", he said\\nafter his release, \"but there, in Tulkarm, in the interrogations\\nrooms, you cannot find even one person about whom you can say that\\nhe is a human being\". Although he left the detention installation\\nin Tulkarm bruised and humiliated (\"I sat at home for ten days. My\\nhands shook from nerves\"), one may consider Omar Jaber lucky: He\\ngot out, not so healthy, but entire, and even ultimately returned\\nto normal functioning, at the small solar heater plant he owns.\\n\\nIn contrast, Hassan Bader al-Zbeidi, for example, was released\\nseven weeks ago from detention in Tulkarm after 33 days in the\\nShabak wing, cut off from his surroundings. He doesn\\'t speak or\\nreact. Mustafa Barakat, aged only 23, who was arrested in early\\nAugust and was brought to the Tulkarm detention installation, left\\nit one day later - dead. \"We have recently received an especially\\nlarge number of testimonies concerning cruel tortures employed at\\nthe Tulkarm detention installation by Shabak interrogators\", noted\\nDr. Niv Gordon, director of the Association of Israel and\\nPalestinian Physicians for Human Rights. (...)\\n\\nThe right to complain against the Shabak does not excite Anan\\nSaber Makhlouf, a 20 year old student. In fact, he was extremely\\nfearful about describing the manner in which he was interrogated\\nin Tulkarm prison, in case the publication in the paper would\\nreturn him to detention and lead to renewed mistreatment.\\n\\n(...follow description of tortures....)\\n\\nOmar, a tall bearded man, was silent. \"I do not want to talk about\\nit\", he finally said, quietly. Some time later, embarrased and\\nashamed, he spoke: \"Sometimes he beats you and beats you until\\nyou\\'ll kiss his hand, and not only his hand. Even the hands of\\nanother interrogator, and another, whom he calls into the room,\\nand the last interrogator says:\" Now you are kissing my hand, and\\nlater if I want, you will kiss my ass.\"\\n\\nThese things take place in an Israeli army detention installation,\\nlocated within the military government compound in Tulkarm (West\\nBank). But the Shabak interrogation wing is a separate kingdom. In\\nearly March the IDF allowed representatives of B\\'Tselem, the\\nIsraeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Territories, to\\nvisit Tulkarm prison, but denied them access to the interrogation\\nwing. \"The interrogation wing is Shabak property, being solely\\nunder Shabak responsibility. All interrogations are performed by\\nit\", said Lieutnant Sharon Sho\\'an, the commander of the\\ninstallation, according to the internal report written by B\\'tselem\\nmember, Yuval Ginbar, following the visit. Major David Pe\\'er,\\ngoverning commander of the prison system in the Central Command,\\nwas quoted in the report:  \"There is an ethical problem here - no\\none can enter the interrogation wing\".\\n\\nTransl. by I.

For the sake of brevity, I\\'ll present them in some separate\\n    points.\\n\\n    1- As many other western programs, this program was laid on a bed of\\n    misinformation throughout the program, to maximize the effect of the\\n    program on the viewer. Some of the misinformations were as follows:\\n\\n    - It was alleged that:\" Late Imam Khomeini objected to Shah\\'s technological\\n    advancements as anti-Islamic, but now things have changed and the proof of\\n    change is that some Iranian merchants are now selling personal computers. \"!\\n    These are the most ridiculous lies, one can make about the objectives \\n    of the Islamic Revolution in toppling the Shah and state of the technology\\n    in Iran after revolution.\\n\\n    -Iran was equally accused of using chemical weapons against Iraqi aggressors\\n    while there has never been any proof in this regard, and nobody has seen\\n    Iraqi soldiers or civilians injured by Iranian chemical weapons, in\\n    contrary to what the whole world has seen about Iranian soldiers and\\n    civilians, injured by Iraqi chemical weapons.\\n\\n    - While the number of martyrs during the sacred defense against Iraqi\\n    aggression has been officially announced to be about 117,000 and even most\\n    radical counter-revolutionary groups claim that Iran and Iraq had a total\\n    of one million dead, this program claims that Iran alone has one million\\n    dead left from the war.\\n\\n    - The translation of Iranian officials\\' talks are not 100% true. For\\n    example when Iranian head of Atomic Energy says that: \" It hurts me to\\n    see that Iran is the subject of these unfriendly propaganda.\" The \\n    translator says: \" It hurts to see that Iran is doing unfriendly \\n    research.\"!\\n\\n    2- Almost all alleged devices or material bought or planned to be bought\\n    by Iranians were of countless dual usage, while the program tries to \\n    undermine their non-military uses, without any reference to Iran\\'s\\n    big population and its inevitable need to other sources of energy in\\n    near future and its current deficit in electrical power.\\n\\n    3- The whole program is trying to show the Sharif University of \\n    Technology as a nuclear research center, while even the cameramen of the\\n    program know well that in a country like Iran without a so tightly closed\\n    society no one can make a nuclear bomb in a university! Taking in account\\n    the scientific advancement of Sharif U. in engineering fields and its\\n    potential role in improvement of Iran\\'s industries and eventually the\\n    lives of people, it is obvious that they are persuading other countries\\n    to prevent them from further helping this university or other ones\\n    in scientific and industrial efforts.\\n\\n    4- A key point in program\\'s justifications is trying to disvalidate as\\n    much as possible all efforts done by IAEA [*] in their numerous visits from\\n    Iran\\'s different sites. They say: \"We are not sure if the places visited\\n    by IAEA are the real ones or not\" !, or \" We can not rely on IAEA\\'s\\n    reports and observation, because they failed to see Iraq\\'s nuclear\\n    activities before\" as if they didn\\'t know that Iraq was trying to build\\n    nuclear weapons!\\n\\n    5- As an extremely personal opinion, the most disgusting aspect of the\\n    program was the arrogance of the member of US Senate foreign Affairs,\\n    William Triplet, in his way of talking, as if he was the god talking\\n    from the absolute knowledge!\\n\\n       I hope all Iranians be aware of the gradual buildup against their\\n    country in western media, and I hope Iranian authorities continue to\\n    their wise and calculated approach with regard to international affairs\\n    and peaceful coexistence with friendly nations.\\n\\n\\nMohammad\\n\\n  \\n    [*] International Atomic Energy Agency\\n  \\n',\n",

Dec. 1989\\n\\nLeading Israeli author and cultural commentator, A.B. Yehoshua,\\nlaunched a ferocious attack on diaspora Jewry at a Zionist Youth\\nCouncil meeting in North London, last week.\\n\\nThe diaspora, he claimed, \"was the cancer connected to the main\\ntissue of the Jewish people\". He was scathing about its failure to\\nact before the Holocaust.\\n\\nHe said the diaspora\\'s religious and secular leadership had\\nignored the warning signs in the 1920s, and had fiercely opposed\\nZionism. Consequently, he considered the Holocaust, \"the failure\\nof Judaism\".\\n\\nHis talk, entitled \"Diaspora: A Neurotic Solution\", covered 5,000\\nyears of Jewish history.\\n\\nMr. Yehoshua\\'s other targets included Soviet Jews who were, he\\nsaid \"not staying [in Israel], but running [away]\", and all Jews\\noutside Israel \"who were using other people\\'s countries like\\nhotels\".\\n\\nThe only conclusion he could draw was that the diaspora was\\nimmoral, because it looked to Israel for its identity but lived\\nelsewhere.\\n\\nWorse, it threatened Israel itself, creating a distraction for her\\ncitizens, who were leaving by the thousands.\\n\\nMr. Yehoshua, who described himself as \"a soldier for aliyah\",\\nended by calling for the creation of a new \"total Jew\", living in\\nIsrael.\\n\\nEarlier, speaking at a meeting of Jewish students on the\\ndifficulties of forging a national identity in Israeli literature,\\nMr. Yehoshua claimed that Israeli writers were paralyzed by the\\ncountry\\'s political situation.\\n\\nHe said Israel\\'s wars had once provided writers with a vital\\nsource of inspiration.  Today, Israeli writers avoided writing\\ndirectly about the Arab-Israeli conflict. No major work had been\\nproduced about the intifada.\\n\\nInstead, writers were tackling themes such as Jewish identity,\\nemigration from Israel and personal and family issues.\\n\\nMr. Yehoshua admitted he also felt unable to write about the\\nIsraeli political situation. He could no longer step into an\\nIsraeli Arab\\'s shoes and portray him as a real \"flesh and blood\\ncharacter\".\\n\\nHe claimed that after 40 years of statehood, the problem of\\nIsraeli identity had not been solved. He said Jews remained too\\npre-occupied with the borders of identity between Jew and non-Jew,\\nand were not concerned with the nature of that identity.\\n\\nJewish values in Israel embraced every aspect of daily life,\\nunlike in the diaspora, where Jews had no responsibility for the\\ncountry they lived in, he said.\\n\\nHe warned that modern Hebrew, a unifying force for the Jewish\\npeople, would have to struggle for its future, especially in\\nliterary circles.

A further 4,000 are believed to be wounded, frozen to death \\nor missing... \\n\\nSeven of us squatted in the cabin of an Azerbaijani M24 attack helicopter \\nas we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings. Suddenly there \\nwas a thump against the underside of the aircraft, a red flash of tracer \\nripped past the starboard wing, and the helicopter rocked sharply. We \\nswung round, and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon \\nunder our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire.\\n\\nWe had been fired on from an Armenian anti-aircraft post. We swung round \\nagain, tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a \\nvalley. The brown earth swooped around our heads, the helicopter swung \\nround again and followed the contours of the ground. Our cannon fired \\nrepeated blasts.\\n\\nLater it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting \\nhad landed successfully at Nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed \\nenclave of Nagorno-Karabakh, to pick up some of the dead. We had, in \\nfact, been attacked both by ground fire and by an Armenian helicopter. \\nI had seen the Armenian helicopter intermittently through the window, \\nits cannons firing, but had thought - mistakenly - that it was on \\n\"our side\". Our group of Western journalists had embarked on a \\nsearch-and-rescue flight that had become a combat mission.\\n\\nOur flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two \\nM24 Soviet attack helicopters in the Azerbaijani service, nicknamed \\nflying crocodiles for their armour. Our party was in the second \\ncrocodile. The civilian helicopter\\'s job was to land in the mountains \\nand pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings. The attack helicopters \\nwere there to give covering fire if necessary.\\n\\nThe operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the Soviet \\narmed forces because our pilot was a Russian officer. An Azerbaijani \\nofficial told us that there were now five former Soviet military \\nhelicopters -and their pilots- fighting for Azerbaijan. \"They have \\nsigned contracts to fly for us,\" he said. The helicopter we engaged \\nin combat was most probably flown by a brother-officer of our Russian \\npilot, but fighting for the Armenians.\\n\\nWe had taken off just before 5pm on Saturday from Agdam airfield, an \\nheated for the Armenian-controlled mountains of Karabakh, a sheer \\nwhite wall in the distance. The civilian helicopter picked up four \\ncorpses, and it was during this and a previous mission that an \\nAzerbaijani cameraman filmed the several the several dozen bodies \\non the hillsides. We then took off again in a hurry and speed back \\ntowards Azerbaijani lines.

He works\\nhard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to\\ncostly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an\\noffensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed\\nto make the team next year.\\n\\n#3\\tDAVID WILLIAMS\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, free agent from New Jersey\\nGrade:\\t\\tC/C-\\n\\nIMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in \\'91-92,\\nplaying a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and\\ngood defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,\\nwas good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that\\n\\'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he\\nwas prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the\\nplaymaking skills that made him the team\\'s leading scorer among defensemen last\\nyear.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.\\n\\n#4\\tJAYSON MORE\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nAfter being touted as the team\\'s top defensive prospects in training camp\\nbefore \\'91-92, More had a rather disappointing \\'91-92, as he was not\\nparticularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,\\nproceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team\\'s most\\nreliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play\\nsteady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.\\nOffensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73\\ngames), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the\\ndefensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.\\n\\n#5\\tNEIL WILKINSON\\t\\tSeason: 4th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB-\\n\\nWilkinson was probably the team\\'s top defensive defenseman in \\'91-92.  However,\\npartially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25\\ngames total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed\\neven when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;\\nthat is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if\\nhe can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.\\n\\n#6\\tSANDIS OZOLINSH\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A)\\n\\nAt the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),\\nOzolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team\\'s MVP.  A serious knee injury\\nin that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),\\nbut he still finished as the team\\'s top scorer among defensemen (23 points),\\nwhich, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from\\ntheir defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh\\'s abilities.  At the time, he\\nwas playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still\\nsusceptible to so-called \"rookie mistakes,\" but was probably the defenseman who\\nmade the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back\\nfrom his injuries, he is ready to be a star.\\n\\n#19\\tDOUG ZMOLEK\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB\\n\\nZmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks\\nto play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but\\nafter being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn\\'t show it (15 points).\\nHe was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the\\nteam; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough\\nphysical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to\\nbecome a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and\\ndefensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

At that village, whose name was publicized\\nthroughout the world, both sides suffered heavy casualties. We had\\nfour killed and nearly forty wounded. The number of casualties was\\nnearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers. The Arab\\ntroops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy. The fighting\\nwas thus very severe. Yet the hostile propaganda, disseminated\\nthroughout the world, deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian\\npopulation of Dir Yassin was actually given a warning by us before the\\nbattle began. One of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed\\nat the entrance to the village and it exhorted in Arabic all women,\\nchildren and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the\\nslopes of the hill.  By giving this humane warning our fighters threw\\naway the element of complete surprise, and thus increased their own\\nrisk in the ensuing battle. A substantial number of the inhabitants\\nobeyed the warning and they were unhurt. A few did not leave their\\nstone houses - perhaps because of the confusion. The fire of the enemy\\nwas murderous - to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent\\ntestimony. Our men were compelled to fight for every house; to\\novercome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades. And the\\ncivilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable\\ncasualties.\\n\\n    \"The education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of\\nrevolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war. We\\nnever broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us, in\\naccordance with the accepted custom of war, to apply reprisals. I am\\nconvinced, too, that our officers and men wished to avoid a single\\nunnecessary casualty in the Dir Yassin battle. But those who throw\\nstones of denunciation at the conquerors of Dir Yassin [1] would do\\nwell not to don the cloak of hypocrisy [2].\\n\\n    \"In connection with the capture of Dir Yassin the Jewish Agency\\nfound it necessary to send a letter of apology to Abdullah, whom Mr.\\nBen Gurion, at a moment of great political emotion, called \\'the wise\\nruler who seeks the good of his people and this country.\\' The \\'wise\\nruler,\\' whose mercenary forces demolished Gush Etzion and flung the\\nbodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey, replied with feudal\\nsuperciliousness. He rejected the apology and replied that the Jews\\nwere all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of\\n\\'dissidents.\\' Throughout the Arab world and the world at large a wave\\nof lying propaganda was let loose about \\'Jewish attrocities.\\'\\n\\n    \"The enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name. In the\\nresult it helped us. Panic overwhelmed the Arabs of Eretz Israel.\\nKolonia village, which had previously repulsed every attack of the\\nHaganah, was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting.\\nBeit-Iksa was also evacuated. These two places overlooked the main\\nroad; and their fall, together with the capture of Kastel by the\\nHaganah, made it possible to keep open the road to Jerusalem. In the\\nrest of the country, too, the Arabs began to flee in terror, even\\nbefore they clashed with Jewish forces. Not what happened at Dir\\nYassin, but what was invented about Dir Yassin, helped to carve the\\nway to our decisive victories on the battlefield. The legend of Dir\\nYassin helped us in particular in the saving of Tiberias and the\\nconquest of Haifa.\"\\n\\n\\n[1] (A footnote from _The Revolt_, pp.226-7.) \"To counteract the loss\\nof Dir yassin, a village of strategic importance, Arab headquarters at\\nRamallah broadcast a crude atrocity story, alleging a massacre by\\nIrgun troops of women and children in the village. Certain Jewish\\nofficials, fearing the Irgun men as political rivals, seized upon this\\nArab gruel propaganda to smear the Irgun. An eminent Rabbi was induced\\nto reprimand the Irgun before he had time to sift the truth. Out of\\nevil, however, good came. This Arab propaganda spread a legend of\\nterror amongst Arabs and Arab troops, who were seized with panic at\\nthe mention of Irgun soldiers. The legend was worth half a dozen\\nbattalions to the forces of Israel. The `Dir Yassin Massacre\\' lie\\nis still propagated by Jew-haters all over the world.\"\\n\\n[2] In reference to denunciation of Dir Yassin by fellow Jews.\\n',\n",

If you are uninterested, since I will\\nhave the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can\\nkill them.\\n\\nI will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,\\nare subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as\\npossible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks\\nand/or did not play for another NHL team this season.\\n\\nThus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...\\n\\n#1\\tBRIAN HAYWARD\\t\\tSeason:\\t11th\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tP (D)\\n\\nIt is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that\\nfeatured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and\\n'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing\\ngrade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this\\nyear, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would\\nnot be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.\\n\\nBut Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first\\never victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.\\nAs he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.\\n\\n#30\\tJEFF HACKETT\\t\\tSeason: 3rd\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tC\\n\\nHackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply\\nwasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,\\nalmost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save\\npercentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to\\nbench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry\\nthe team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early\\ninjury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,\\nbut upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next\\nyear.\\n\\n#31\\tWADE FLAHERTY\\t\\tSeason: 1st (still eligible as rookie)\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (A-)\\n\\nIt is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the\\nincomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary\\nFlames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started\\nthe season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'\\nowner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP\\nhonors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he\\ntries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs\\nIrbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up\\nall-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can\\nshare the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor\\nRobins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he\\nmay not ever.\\n\\n#32\\tARTURS IRBE\\t\\tSeason:\\t1st\\nAcquired:\\t'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tB+\\n\\nI may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that\\nhe's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has\\nprovided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting\\nthe team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.\\nHe has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and\\nmaking passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the\\ngoonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do\\nwith such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for\\na playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named\\nas a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

The most recent\\nresearch  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State\\nUniversity  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns\\nare  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by\\ncriminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in\\nthis  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when\\nyou  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because\\nof  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding\\nprivate  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study\\nof  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%\\nof  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime\\nbecause  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,\\nand  57% agreed that \"most criminals are more worried  about\\nmeeting an armed victim than they are about running into the\\npolice.\"2\\n     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the\\nwomen  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation\\nthat  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in\\nresponse  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This\\nshould be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando\\nFlorida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960\\'s  the  female\\npopulace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just\\nthe  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and\\nobtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for\\nthat  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to\\nexperience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,\\na 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes\\nshowed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion\\nrate  is 36%.

Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings\\nfailed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.\\nDahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30\\nsecond 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in\\nthe period.\\n\\n2nd period: \\nThe Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed\\nto convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into\\nthe stands and received a delay of game.\\n\\n1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the\\npuck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit \\nthe stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated \\ndown the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and\\nskated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him \\nand he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.\\n\\n2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.\\nShuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed\\nfor the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot \\nwhere 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson\\ncame from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot\\nbetween the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.\\n\\n3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off\\nthe puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass\\ncross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,\\nbeating a diving Vernon on the glove side.\\n\\n4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the\\nnear point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his\\nown rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low\\nslot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.\\n\\nSkrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at\\n12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they\\nfailed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive\\npower plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high\\nsticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The\\nKings hit 3 goal post in the period.\\n\\n3rd period:\\nThe Kings used the phrase \"Initiate, not retaliate\" and it was very evident here\\nin the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames \\ncontinued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.\\n\\n5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot\\nthe puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to\\ncut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,\\nwacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the\\ncrease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net\\nwhere Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.\\n\\nSydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.\\n\\n5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net\\nand passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the \\ncrease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.\\n\\nCarson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury\\ntripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where \\nFleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing \\na 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the \\nKings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at \\n8:19) took penalties.  \\n\\n5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near \\npoint, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the\\nnet, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of\\nHrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.\\n\\n6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play\\nto seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone \\ncut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed \\nthe puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, \\nbeating Vernon on the ice, stick side.\\n\\nAt the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he\\nwent after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single\\nminor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames\\nright out of the game.\\n\\nOn the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey\\nas they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent\\npenalty killing.\\n\\nOn the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or\\nthe Flames will surely get that power play back on track.\\n\\nNotes:\\n------\\nThe Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.\\n\\nWayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.\\n\\nThe Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving\\nthe opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.\\n\\nFlames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon \\ngames.

Can anybody deny these facts?\\n\\nJews killed Germans in WWII -- Germans killed Jews in WWII, BUT there was \\nquite a difference in these two statements, regardless of what Nazi \\nrevisionists say!\\n\\n[SY] My grand parents were living partly in todays Armenia and partly in\\n[SY] todays Georgia. There were villages, Kurd/Turk (different Turkic groups)\\n[SY] Georgian (muslim/christian) Armenian and Farsi... Very near to eachother.\\n[SY] The people living there were aware of their differences. They were \\n[SY] different people. For example, my grandfather would not have been happy \\n[SY] if his doughter had willed to marry an Armenian guy. But that did not \\n[SY] mean that they were willing to kill eachother. No! They were neighbors.\\n\\nOK.\\n\\n[SY] Armenians killed Turks. Which Armenians? Their neoghbors? As far as my\\n[SY] grandparents are concerned, the Armenians attacked first but these \\n[SY] Armenians were not their neighbors. They came from other places. Maybe \\n[SY] first they had a training at some place. They were taught to kill people,\\n[SY] to hate Turks/Kurds? It seems so...\\n\\nThere is certainly a difference between the planned extermination of the\\nArmenians of eastern Turkey beginning in 1915, with that of the Armeno-\\nGeorgian conflicts of late 1918! The argument is not whether Armenians ever \\nkilled in their collective existence, but rather the wholesale destruction of\\nAnatolian Armenians under orders of the Turkish government. An Armenian-\\nGeorgian dispute over the disposition of Akhalkalak, Lori, and Pambak after\\nthe Turkish Third Army evacuated the region, cannot be equated with the\\nextermination of Anatolian Armenians. Many Armenians and Georgians died\\nin this area in the scramble to re-occupy these lands and the lack of\\npreparation for the winter months. This is not the same as the Turkish \\ngenocide of the Armenians nearly four years earlier, hundreds of kilometers\\naway!\\n\\n[SY] Anyway, but after they killed/raped/... Turks and other muslim people\\n[SY] around, people assumed that \\'Armenians killed us, raped our women\\',\\n[SY] not a particular group of people trained in some camps, maybe backed\\n[SY] by some powerful states... After that step, you cannot explain these \\n[SY] people not to hate all Armenians. \\n\\nI don\\'t follow, perhaps the next paragraph will shed some light.\\n\\n[SY] So what am I trying to point out? First, at least for that region,\\n[SY] you cannot blame Turks/Kurds etc since it was a self defense situation.\\n[SY] Most of the Armenians, I think, are not to blame either. But since some\\n[SY] people started that fire, it is not easy to undo it. There are facts.\\n[SY] People cannot trust eachother easily. It is very difficult to establish\\n[SY] a good relation based on mutual respect and trust between nations with\\n[SY] different ethnic/cultural/religious backgrounds but it is unfortunately\\n[SY] very easy to start a fire!\\n\\nAgain, the fighting between Armenians and Georgians in 1918/19 had little to\\ndo with the destruction of the Armenians in Turkey. It is interesting that\\nthe Georgian leaders of the Transcaucasian Federation (Armenia, Azerbaijan, \\nand Georgia) made special deals with Turkish generals not to pass through \\nTiflis on their way to Baku, in return for Georgians not helping the Armenians \\nmilitarily. Of course, as Turkish troops marched across what was left of\\nCaucasian Armenia, many Armenians went north and such population movement \\ncaused problems with the locals. This is in no comparison with events 4 years \\nearlier in eastern Anatolia. My father\\'s mother\\'s family escaped Cemiskezek -> \\nErzinka -> Erzerum -> Nakhitchevan -> Tiflis -> Constantinople -> \\nMassachusetts. \\n\\n[SY] My grandparents were *not* bloodthirsty people. We did not experience\\n[SY] what they had to endure... They had to leave their lands, there were\\n[SY] ladies, old ladies, all of her children killed while she forced to\\n[SY] witness! Young women put dirt at their face to make themselves\\n[SY] unattractive! I don\\'t want to go into any graphic detail.\\n\\nMy grandmother\\'s brother was forced to dress up as a Kurdish women, and paste\\npotato skins on his face to look ugly. The Turks would kill any Armenian\\nyoung man on sight in Dersim. Because their family was rather influential,\\nlocal Kurds helped them escape before it was too late. This is why I am alive \\ntoday.\\n\\n[SY] You may think that my sources are biased. They were biased in some sense.\\n[SY] They experienced their own pain, of course. That is the way it is.

Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.\\nBrian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good\\ngoaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the\\nstretch to preserve the Blues lead.\\n\\nThe Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and\\ntaking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty\\non Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the\\nblue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired\\na long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After\\nthe goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks\\n10-9 in the first period.\\n\\nJeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on\\nthe left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour\\ncame out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown\\ncollected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.\\n\\nTwo minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a\\nshort-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy\\nRoenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass\\nacross the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.\\n\\nNoonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.\\nStephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat\\nStephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan\\ndeflected the puck in the net.\\n\\nDenny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the\\nrebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for\\nthe shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards\\nto Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues\\noutshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.\\n\\nWith the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked\\nup a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith\\nwas called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.\\n\\nThe Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into\\nthe two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,\\nand Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and\\npassed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp\\nangle.\\n\\nJust 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson\\nEmerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with\\ntwo Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the\\nslot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.\\n\\nThe Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph\\nmade some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy\\nMurray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.\\nThe Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the\\npuck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held\\non to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,\\ntotaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent\\nin the game.

Neil Smith\\n\\n                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE\\n\\n[AUTHOR\\'S NOTE:  \"Adrian\" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- \\nand the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with \\nthe same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]\\n\\nDear Adrian:  \\n\\nI\\'m way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to \\nyour note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and \\ngenerally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist \\nmostly of assertions you\\'re free to believe (or not) I can back \\nwith evidence and logic I\\'ve neither time nor energy to present \\nnow.  I\\'ve written fully on this topic before and will again in the \\nfuture.  When I do, I\\'ll make sure you get copies.  \\n\\nThere are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger \\nof delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. \\n10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, \\nshifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic \\nrifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I\\'ll \\nlimit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent \\nwith your note.  \\n\\nFirst, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nSecond, publication of some latter-day \"scientific study\" doesn\\'t \\nalter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my \\ninterview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  \\n\\nThird, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nFourth, as often happens with these things, the \"study\" doesn\\'t \\nsupport the gun prohibitionists\\' original numerical contentions \\nanyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older \\nbody of lies, omissions, and distortions.  \\n\\nFifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nSixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on \\ncountless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND \\nBEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this \\npresent \"study\" dubious, to say the least.  \\n\\nSeventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \\na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \\nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \\nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nEighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat \\n(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you \\nshould be better aware than most people how \"progress\" -- in \\ndesigning \"studies\" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our \\nability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree \\non is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 \\nyears to create \"studies\" \"proving\" that pornography causes crime.  \\nMore naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s \\nclearly indicate the contrary.  \\n\\nNinth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nTenth, another reason to doubt all such \"studies\" is that human \\nbehavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far\\ntoo complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The \\nattempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the \\nresulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  \\n\\nEleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is \\na natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, \\nand Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic \\nprocess nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nTwelfth, the \"study\" is also worthless because it incorporates \\nfigures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but \\nbasically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social \\nbenefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a \\ncriminal offense.  \\n\\nThirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials \\nquoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are \\nmany), are correct in this instance:  the \"study\" is meaningless \\nbecause the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a \\nnatural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and \\nConstitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process \\nnor to arguments grounded in social utility.  \\n\\nAnd because of that, Adrian, even if the \"study\" were valid, it \\nwouldn\\'t deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that \\nanyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, \\nwhenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody\\'s \\npermission. In this I\\'m ably assisted by gun prohibitionists \\nthemselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed \\npeople to go out and buy their first gun \"while they still can\".  \\nBefore the \\'68 Gun Control Act, most of the \"shooting fraternity\" \\nviewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, \\nineffective toys.  There probably weren\\'t six million of them in \\nthe whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, \\nand their ilk -- AMERICA\\'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we \\nprobably manufacture at least that many every year.\\n\\nThe fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly \\naware of this -- so I guess you\\'ll have to ask them yourself what \\ntheir real motives are.  \\n\\nLook:  gun-making isn\\'t an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, \\nit\\'s easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; \\nthe fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the \\nself-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing \\nthis further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a \\nquarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated \"half life\" \\nof 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna \\nbe around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.\\n\\nAs for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law \\nprovides or any court decides, I\\'m always going to be armed.  And I \\nwill always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is \\nthat there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands \\n-- where I come from.  We can\\'t be stopped by passing laws, we can \\nonly be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given \\nboth the practical and alleged differences between full automatics \\nand semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  \\n\\nSo what\\'s the point?  \\n\\nL.

Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays\\n6-3 opening victory.\\n\\nBut Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick\\nKnickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the\\nstretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.\\n\\nKnickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was \\nyanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn\\'t played since March 29.\\n\\nYet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey\\'s backup\\nagain and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic\\nSaddledome popcorn.\\n\\n\"If I\\'m supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I\\ndropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?\"  Stauber wondered.  \"Not that I\\'d be\\nhappy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the\\nplayoffs.\"\\n\\nPerhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not\\nconvinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.\\n\\nWhile insisting he is the Kings\\' \"goalie of the future,\" Melrose said Stauber\\nflubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,\\naccording to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New\\nYork Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to \\nVancouver on Thursday.\\n\\n\"Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could\\nhave taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn\\'t do it,\" Melrose said.  \"An\\nelite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a\\ngreat goalie is that he isn\\'t satisfied to be a backup.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you\\'re going to be No. 1, you\\'ve\\ngot to be able to walk your talk.  You\\'ve got to be able to play when everything\\nis on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect\\nmore from him than he does.\"\\n\\nOuch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the\\nteam hit a mid-season slump, didn\\'t play for a month after Knickle was signed\\noff the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.\\n\\n\"I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,\" said Stauber,\\na three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only \\nto have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.\\n\\n\"What I\\'ve been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated\\ndisk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do\\nexpect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn\\'t be here.\"\\n\\n\"Anybody who would disagree with that doesn\\'t know me.  I\\'m not saying Barry \\ndoesn\\'t know me, but don\\'t say I\\'ve been without expectations.  If anything, I\\'m\\na perfectionist.\"\\n\\nStauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. \"But \\neven though I didn\\'t play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It\\'s \\na bit of a jump,\" he said.  \"You\\'re almost No. 1, or if you play a good game \\nyou\\'re No. 1 and if you don\\'t you\\'re No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 \\nand then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That\\'s what barry wanted me to explain \\nto him, why I didn\\'t come through when he counted on me.  I don\\'t know. What I \\ndo know is, it\\'s a sport.  I\\'ll be there.\"\\n\\nMelrose\\'s \"goalie of the future\" statement doesn\\'t mean much to Stauber. \"Before\\nyou know it, I\\'ll be 30 and there will be no future,\" he said.\\n\\n------\\n\\n*Game 1 of the Kings @ Flames playoff series drew a 4.2 Nielsen rating on ABC \\nChannel 7 here in LA.

What \\nwas he killed for. He hadn\\'t hurt anyone, hadn\\'t said any word he oughtn\\'t \\nhave. Why did they kill him? I want to find out--from here, from there, from \\nthe government--why my husband was killed.\\n\\nOn the 27th, when I returned from work--it was a Saturday--my son was at home.\\nHe doesn\\'t work. I went straight to the kitchen, and he called me, \"Mamma, is \\nthere a soccer game?\" There were shouts from Lenin Street. That\\'s where we \\nlived. I say, \"I don\\'t know, Igor, I haven\\'t turned on the TV.\" He looked \\nagain and said, \"Mamma, what\\'s going on in the courtyard?!\" I look and see so \\nmany people, it\\'s awful, marching, marching, there are hundreds, thousands, \\nyou can\\'t even tell how many there are. They\\'re shouting, \"Down with the \\nArmenians! Kill the Armenians! Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" My God, why is \\nthat happening, what for? I had known nothing at that point. We lived together\\nwell, in friendship, and suddenly something like this. It was completely \\nunexpected. And they were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" And they had flags,\\nand they were shouting. There was a man walking in front well dressed, he\\'s \\naround 40 or 45, in a gray raincoat. He is walking and saying something, I \\ncan\\'t make it out through the vent window. He is walking and saying something,\\nand the children behind him are shouting, \"Tear the Armenians to pieces!\" and \\n\"Down with the Armenians!\" They shout it again, and then shout, \"Hurrah!\" The \\npeople streamed without end, they were walking in groups, and in the groups I \\nsaw that there were women, too. I say, \"My God, there are women there too!\" \\nAnd my son says, \"Those aren\\'t women, Mamma, those are bad women.\" Well we \\ndidn\\'t look a long time. They were walking and shouting and I was afraid, I \\nsimply couldn\\'t sit still. I went out onto the balcony, and my Azerbaijani \\nneighbor is on the other balcony, and I say, \"Khalida, what\\'s going on, what \\nhappened?\" She says, \"Emma, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know, I don\\'t know what \\nhappened.\" Well she was quite frightened too. They had these white sticks, \\neach second or third one had a white rod. They\\'re waving the rods above their \\nheads as they walk, and the one who\\'s out front, like a leader, he has a white\\nstick too. Well maybe it was an armature shaft, but what I saw was white, I \\ndon\\'t know.\\n\\nMy husband got home 10 or 15 minutes later. He comes home and I say, \"Oh \\ndear, I\\'m frightened, they\\'re going to kill us I bet.\" And he says, \"What are \\nyou afraid of, they\\'re just children.\" I say, \"Everything that happens comes \\nfrom children.\" There had been 15- and 16-year kids from the Technical and \\nVocational School. \"Don\\'t fear,\" he said, \"it\\'s nothing, nothing all that \\nbad.\" He didn\\'t eat, he just lay on the sofa. And just then on television they\\nbroadcast that two Azerbaijanis had been killed in Karabakh, near Askeran. \\nWhen I heard that I couldn\\'t settle down at all, I kept walking here and \\nthere and I said, \"They\\'re going to kill us, the Azerbaijanis are going to \\nkill us.\" And he says, \"Don\\'t be afraid.\" Then we heard--from the central \\nsquare, there are women shouting near near the stage, well, they\\'re shouting\\ndifferent things, and you couldn\\'t hear every well. I say, \"You speak\\nAzerbaijani well, listen to what they\\'re saying.\" He says \"Close the window\\nand go to bed, there s nothing happening there.\" He listened a bit and then \\nclosed the window and went to bed, and told us, \"Come on, go to sleep, it\\'s\\nnothing.\" Sleep, what did he mean sleep?  My Son and I stood at the window\\nuntil two in the morning watching. Well he\\'s sick, and all of this was\\naffecting him. I say, \"Igor, you go to bed, I\\'m going to go to bed in a minute\\ntoo.\" He went and I sat at the window until three, and then went to bed. \\nThings had calmed down slightly.\\n\\nThe 28th, Sunday, was my day off. My husband got up and said, \"Come on, Emma, \\nget up.\" I say, \"Today\\'s my day off, let me rest.\" He says, \"Aren\\'t you going \\nto make me some tea?\" Well I felt startled and got up, and said, \"Where are \\nyou going?\" He says, \"I\\'m going out, I have to.\" I say, \"Can you really go \\noutside on a day like today? Don\\'t go out, for God\\'s sake. You never listen to\\nme, I know, and you\\'re not going to listen to me now, but at least don\\'t take \\nthe car out of the garage, go without the car.\" And he says, \"Come on, close \\nthe door!\" And then on the staircase he muttered something, I couldn\\'t make it\\nout, he probably said \"coward\" or something.\\n\\nI closed the door and he left. And I started cleaning . . . picking things up\\naround the house . . . Everything seemed quiet until one o\\'clock in the after-\\nnoon, but at the bus station, my neighbor told me, cars were burning. I said,\\n\"Khalida, was it our car?\" She says, \"No, no, Emma, don\\'t be afraid, they\\nwere government cars and Zhigulis.\\'\\' Our car is a GAZ-21 Volga. And I waited,\\nit was four o\\'clock, five o\\'clock . . . and when he wasn\\'t home at seven I\\nsaid, \"Oh, they\\'ve killed Shagen!\"\\n\\nTires are burning in town, there\\'s black smoke in town, and I\\'m afraid, I\\'m \\nstanding on the balcony and I\\'m all . . . my whole body is shaking. My God, \\nthey\\'ve probably killed him! So basically I waited like that until ten \\no\\'clock and he still hadn\\'t come home. And I\\'m afraid to go out. At ten\\no\\'clock I look out: across from our building is a building with a bookstore,\\nand from upstairs, from the second floor, everything is being thrown outside. \\nI\\'m looking out of one window and Igor is looking out of the other, and I \\ndon\\'t want him to see this, and he, as it turns out, doesn\\'t want me to see \\nit. We wanted to hide it from one another. I joined him. \"Mamma,\" he says,\\n\"look what they\\'re doing over there!\" They were burning everything, and there \\nwere police standing there, 10 or 15 of them, maybe twenty policemen standing \\non the side, and the crowd is on the other side, and two or three people are \\nthrowing everything down from the balcony. And one of the ones on the balcony \\nis shouting, \"What are you standing there for, burn it!\" When they threw the \\ntelevision, wow, it was like a bomb! Our neighbor on the third floor came out \\non her balcony and shouted, \"Why are you doing that, why are you burning those\\nthings, those people saved with such difficulty to buy those things for their \\nhome. Why are you burning them?\" And from the courtyard they yell at her, \"Go \\ninside, go inside! Instead why don\\'t you tell us if they are any of them in \\nyour building or not?\" They meant Armenians, but they didn\\'t say Armenians, \\nthey said, \"of them.\" She says, \"No, no, no, none!\" Then she ran downstairs to\\nour place, and says, \"Emma, Emma, you have to leave!\" I say, \"They\\'ve killed\\nShagen anyway, what do we have to live for? It won\\'t be living for me without \\nShagen. Let them kill us, too!\" She insists, saying, \"Emma, get out of here, \\ngo to Khalida\\'s, and give me the key. When they come I\\'ll say that it\\'s my \\ndaughter\\'s apartment, that they\\'re off visiting someone.\" I gave her the key \\nand went to the neighbor\\'s, but I couldn\\'t endure it. I say, \"Igor, you stay \\nhere, I\\'m going to go downstairs, and see, maybe Papa\\'s . . . Papa\\'s there.\"\\n\\nMeanwhile, they were killing the two brothers, Alik and Valery [Albert and \\nValery Avanesians; see the accounts of Rima Avanesian and Alvina Baluian], in \\nthe courtyard. There is a crowd near the building, they\\'re shouting, howling, \\nand I didn\\'t think that they were killing at the time. Alik and Valery lived\\nin the corner house across from ours. When I went out into the courtyard I saw\\nan Azerbaijani, our neighbor, a young man about 30 years old. I say, \"Madar, \\nUncle Shagen\\'s gone, let\\'s go see, maybe he\\'s dead in the garage or near the \\ngarage, let\\'s at least bring the corpse into the house. \"He shouts, \"Aunt \\nEmma, where do you think you\\'re going?! Go back into the house, I\\'ll look for \\nhim.\" I say, \"Something will happen to you, too, because of me, no, Madar, \\nI\\'m coming too.\" Well he wouldn\\'t let me go all the same, he says, \"You stay \\nhere with us, I\\'m go look.\" He went and looked, and came back and said, \"Aunt \\nEmma, there\\'s no one there, the garage is closed. \"Madar went off again and \\nthen returned and said, \"Aunt Emma, they\\'re already killed Alik, and Valery\\'s \\nthere . . . wheezing.\"\\n\\nMadar wanted to go up to him, but those scoundrels said, \"Don\\'t go near him, \\nor we\\'ll put you next to him.\" He got scared--he\\'s young--and came back and \\nsaid, \"I\\'m going to go call, maybe an ambulance will come, at least to take \\nAlik, maybe he\\'ll live . . . \" They grew up together in our courtyard, they \\nknew each other well, they had always been on good terms. He went to call, but\\nnot a single telephone worked, they had all been shut off. He called, and \\ncalled, and called, and called--nothing.\\n\\nI went upstairs to the neighbor\\'s. Igor says, \"Two police cars drove up over \\nthere, their headlights are on, but they\\'re not touching them, they are still \\nlying where they were, they\\'re still lying there . . . \"We watched out the\\nwindow until four o\\'clock, and then went downstairs to our apartment. I didn\\'t\\ntake my clothes off. I lay on the couch so as not to go to bed, and at six\\no\\'clock in the morning I got up and said, \"Igor, you stay here at home, don\\'t\\ngo out, don\\'t go anywhere, I\\'m going to look, I have to find Papa, dead or\\nalive . . . let me go . . . I\\'ve got the keys from work.\"\\n\\nAt six o\\'clock I went to the Emergency Hospital. The head doctor and another \\ndoctor opened the door to the morgue. I run up to them and say, \"Doctor, is \\nShagen there?\" He says, \"What do you mean? Why should Shagen be here?!\" I \\nwanted to go in, but he wouldn\\'t let me. There were only four people in there,\\nthey said. Well, they must have been awful because they didn\\'t let me in. They\\nsaid, \"Shagen\\'s not here, he\\'s alive somewhere, he\\'ll come back.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s already seven o\\'clock in the morning. I look and there is a panel truck\\nwith three policemen. Some of our people from the hospital were there with\\nthem. I say, \"Sara Baji [\"Sister\" Sara, term of endearment], go look, they\\'ve\\nprobably brought Shagen.\" I said it, shouted it, and she went and came back\\nand says, \"No, Emma, he has tan shoes on, it\\'s a younger person.\" Now Shagen \\njust happened to have tan shoes, light tan, they were already old. When they \\nsaid it like that I guessed immediately. I went and said, \"Doctor, they\\'ve \\nbrought Shagen in dead.\" He says, \"Why are you carrying on like that, dead, \\ndead . . . he\\'s alive.\" But then he went all the same, and when he came back \\nthe look on his face was . . . I could tell immediately that he was dead. They\\nknew one another well, Shagen had worked for him a long time. I say, \"Doctor, \\nis it Shagen?\" He says, \"No, Emma, it\\'s not he, it\\'s somebody else entirely.\" \\nI say, \"Doctor, why are you deceiving me, I\\'ll find out all the same anyway, \\nif not today, then tomorrow.\" And he said . . . I screamed, right there in the\\noffice. He says, \"Emma, go, go calm down a little.\" Another one of our \\ncolleagues said that the doctor had said it was Shagen, but . . . in hideous \\ncondition. They tried to calm me down, saying it wasn\\'t Shagen. A few minutes \\nlater another colleague comes in and says, \"Oh, poor Emma!\" When she said it \\nlike that there was no hope left.\\n\\n   That day was awful. They were endlessly bringing in dead and injured \\npeople.\\n\\nAt night someone took me home. I said, \"Igor, Papa\\'s been killed.\"\\n\\nOn the morning of the 1st I left Igor at home again and went to the hospital: \\nI had to bury him somehow, do something. I look and see that the hospital is \\nsurrounded by soldiers. They are wearing dark clothes. \"Hey, citizen, where \\nare you going?\" I say, \"I work here,\" and from inside someone shouts, \"Yes, \\nyes, that\\'s our cook, let her in.\" I went right to the head doctor\\'s office\\nand there is a person from the City Health Department there, he used to\\nwork with us at the hospital. He says, \"Emma, Shagen\\'s been taken to Baku.\\nIn the night they took the wounded and the dead, all of them, to Baku.\" I\\nsay, \"Doctor, how will I bury him?\" He says, \"We\\'re taking care of all that,\\ndon\\'t you worry, we\\'ll do everything, we\\'ll tell you about it. Where did you\\nspend the night?\" I say, \"I was at home.\" He says, \"What do you mean you\\nwere at home?! You were at home alone?\" I say, \"No, Igor was there too.\" He\\nsays, \"You can\\'t stay home, we\\'re getting an ambulance right now, wait just\\none second, the head doctor is coming, we\\'re arranging an ambulance right\\nnow, you put on a lab coat and take one for Igor, you go and bring Igor here\\nlike a patient, and you\\'ll stay here and we\\'ll se~ later what to do next ...\"\\nHis last name is Kagramanov. The head doctor\\'s name is Izyat Jamalogli\\nSadukhov.\\n\\nThe \"ambulance\" arrived and I went home and got Igor. They admitted him as a \\npatient, they gave us a private room, an isolation room. We stayed in the \\nhospital until the 4th.\\n\\nSome police car came and they said, \"Emma, let\\'s go.\" And the women, our \\ncolleagues, then they saw the police car, became anxious and said, \"Where are \\nyou taking her?\" I say, \"They\\'re going to kill me, too . . . \" And the\\ninvestigator says, \"Why are you saying that, we\\'re going to make a positive\\nidentification.\" We went to Baku and they took me into the morgue . . . I\\nstill can\\'t remember what hospital it was . . . The investigator says, \"Let\\'s \\ngo, we need to be certain, maybe it\\'s not Shagen.\" And when I saw the caskets,\\nlying on top of one another, I went out of my mind. I say, \"I can\\'t look, no.\"\\nThe investigator says, \"Are there any identifying marks?\" I say, \"Let me see\\nthe clothes, or the shoes, or even a sock, I\\'ll recognize them.\" He says, \\n\"Isn\\'t they\\'re anything on his body?\" I say he has seven gold teeth and his \\nfinger, he only has half of one of his fingers. Shagen was a carpenter, he had\\nbeen injured at work . . .\\n\\nThey brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing, they \\nbrought them and they were all burned . . . When I saw them I shouted, \"Oh, \\nthey burned him!\" I shouted, I don\\'t know, I fell down . . . or maybe I sat \\ndown, I don\\'t remember. And that investigator says, \"Well fine, fine, since \\nwe\\'ve identified that these are his clothes, and since his teeth . . . since\\nhe has seven gold teeth . . . \"\\n\\nOn the 4th they told me: \"Emma, it\\'s time to bury Shagen now.\" I cried, \"How, \\nhow can I bury Shagen when I have only one son and he\\'s sick? I should inform \\nhis relatives, he has three sisters, I can\\'t do it by myself.\" They say, \"OK, \\nyou know the situation. How will they get here from Karabagh? How will they \\nget here from Yerevan? There\\'s no transportation, it s impossible.\"\\n\\nHe was killed on February 28, and I buried him on March 7. We buried him in \\nSumgait. They asked me, \"Where do you want to bury him?\" I said, \"I want to \\nbury him in Karabagh, where we were born, let me bury him in Karabagh,\" I\\'m \\nshouting, and the head of the burial office, I guess, says, \"Do you know what \\nit means, take him to Karabagh?! It means arson!\" I say, \"What do you mean, \\narson? Don\\'t they know what\\'s going on in Karabagh? The whole world knows that\\nthey killed them, and I want to take him to Karabagh, I don\\'t have anyone \\nanymore.\" I begged, I pleaded, I grieved, I even got down on my knees. He\\nsays, \"Let\\'s bury him here now, and in three months, in six months, a year, \\nif it calms down, I\\'ll help you move him to Karabagh . . . \"\\n\\nOur trial was the first in Sumgait. It was concluded on May 16. At the\\ninvestigation the murderer, Tale Ismailov, told how it all happened, but then\\nat the trial he . . . tried to wriggle . . . he tried to soften his crime. \\nThen they brought a videotape recorder, I guess, and played it, and said, \\n\"Ismailov, look, is that you?\" He says, \"Yes.\" \"Well look, here you\\'re \\ndescribing everything as it was on the scene of the crime, right?\" He says, \\n\"Yes.\" \"And now you\\'re telling it differently?\" He says, \"Well maybe I \\nforgot!\" Like that.\\n\\nThe witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going\\nalong Mir Street, there was a crowd of about 80 people . . . Shagen had a \\nVolga GAZ-21. The 80 people surrounded his car, and all 80 of them were \\ninvolved. One of them was this Ismailov guy, this Tale. They--it\\'s unclear\\nwho--started pulling Shagen out of the car. Well, one says from the left side\\nof the car, another says from the right side. They pulled off his sports \\njacket. He had a jacket on. Well they ask him, \"What\\'s your nationality?\" He \\nsays, \"Armenian.\" Well they say from the crowd they shouted, \"If he\\'s an\\nArmenian, kill him, kill him!\" They started beating him, they broke seven of\\nhis ribs, and his heart . . . I don\\'t know, they did something there, too \\n. . . it\\'s too awful to tell about. Anyway, they say this Tale guy . . . he \\nhad an armature shaft. He says, \"I picked it up, it was lying near a bush, \\nthat\\'s where I got it.\" He said he picked it up, but the witnesses say that he\\nhad already had it. He said, \"I hit him twice,\" he said, \" . . . once or twice\\non the head with that rod.\" And he said that when he started to beat him \\nShagen was sitting on the ground, and when he hit him he fell over. He said, \\n\"I left, right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment,\\nkilling someone,\" he says, \"and I came back to look, is that Shagen alive or\\nnot?\" I said, \"You wanted to finish him, right, and if he was still alive, you\\ncame back to hit him again?\" He went back and looked and he was already dead.\\n\"After that,\" that bastard Tale said, \"after that I went home.\"\\n\\nI said, \"You . . . you . . . little snake,\" I said, \"Are you a thief and a \\nmurderer?\" Shagen had had money in his jacket, and a watch on his wrist. They\\nwere taken. He says he didn\\'t take them\\n\\nWhen they overturned and burned the car, that Tale was no longer there, it was\\nother people who did that. Who it was, who turned over the car and who burned\\nit, that hasn\\'t been clarified as yet. I told the investigator, \"How can you \\nhave the trial when you don\\'t know who burned the car?\" He said something, but\\nI didn\\'t get what he was saying. But I said, \"You still haven\\'t straightened \\neverything out, I think that\\'s unjust.\"\\n\\nWhen they burned the car he was lying next to it, and the fire spread to him. \\nIn the death certificate it says that he had third-degree burns over 80\\npercent of his body . . .\\n\\nAnd I ask again, why was he killed? My husband was a carpenter; he was a good \\ncraftsman, he knew how to do everything, he even fixed his own car, with his \\nown hands. We have three children. Three sons.

You,\" I said, \"you are \\nsaying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is 15 years\\' \\ndeprivation of freedom?\" I screamed, I had my mind! I said, \"Let me at that\\ncreep, with my bare hands I\\'ll . . . \" A relative restrained me, and there\\nwere all those military people there . . . I lest. I said,\" This isn\\'t a \\nSoviet trial, this is unjust!\" That\\'s what I shouted, l said it and left . . .\\n\\nI said that on February 27, when those people were streaming down our street, \\nthey were shouting, \"Long live Turkey!\" and \"Glory to Turkey!\" And during the \\ntrial I said to that Ismailov, \"What does that mean, \\'Glory to Turkey\\'?\" I \\nstill don\\'t understand what Turkey has to do with this, we live in the Soviet \\nUnion.

Some of the land was in fact given to the  \\nJews by the United Nations, quite a bit of it was purchased from Arab  \\nabsentee landlords.

Since,  however, I agree with those who  \\nclaim the West Bank, I think I can answer your question thusly: the West  \\nbank was what is called the spoils of war. Hussein ordered the Arab Legion  \\nto attack Israel, which was a poor move, seeing as how the Israelis  \\npromptly kicked his butt. The territory is therefore forefeit.  Retaining  \\npossession of ALL of the West bank is  not desirable, but it beats  \\nnational suicide for the Israelis. Put another way, one could ask why it  \\nis that so many Palestinians seem to think that Tel-Aviv belongs to them  \\nand the future state of Palestine. As long as this state of affairs  \\ncontinues, it seems that to give the Palestinians a place from which they  \\ncan launch attacks on Jews is a real poor idea. Giving up the entire West  \\nBank would be idiotic froma security standpoint.  In addition, there is  \\nthe small matter of Jerusalem, which is considered to be part of the West  \\nBank. The chances of the Israelis giving up Jerusalem are nil. Even  \\nleftists who think Yasser is a really cool dude, like Yossi Sarid, aren't  \\ngoing to propose giving up Jerusalem.

Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can\\nbe reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at\\nmholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.\\n\\nMark proposed this design, which he calls \"Geode\" (\"rough on the\\noutside, but a gem on the inside\") or the \"ET Strongback with\\nintegrated hab modules and centrifuge.\"  As you can see from file\\ngeodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much\\nof the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The\\nwhite track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte\\nManipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)\\npod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting\\ncan occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass\\nproperties of the Station change during assembly.\\n\\nThe inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because\\nit can approach closer to the Station\\'s CG and at a structurally strong\\npart of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are\\nlimited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the\\ndocking system.\\n\\nThe ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional\\nlaunch mass.  We\\'ve always had the ability to put an ET into orbit\\n(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we\\'ve never\\nhad a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to\\n(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual\\nde-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the\\nresidual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from\\nimpact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a\\nKevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating\\nthe local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing\\nfurther micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,\\nit supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the\\nnucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.\\n\\nThe white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment\\nGyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used\\nfor gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system\\nwhich can be used at the end of the Station\\'s life to perform a\\ncontrolled de-orbit (so we don\\'t kill any more kangaroos, like we\\ndid with Skylab).\\n\\nThe centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be\\nused for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity\\non humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device\\nfor the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on\\none of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.\\n\\nThis design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,\\ndata and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work\\ndone to date.\\n\\nMark proposed this design at Joe Shea\\'s committee in Crystal City,\\nand he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors\\nI hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter\\nseems more likely.\\n\\nPlease note that this text is my interpretation of Mark\\'s design;\\nyou should see his notes in the GIF files.  \\n\\nInstead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for\\nanon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.

       "  'From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins)\\nSubject: RIMSAT, US/Russian joint venture\\nOrganization: University of Illinois at Urbana\\nLines: 121\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I\\'ve \\ntranscribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means\\ninfallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is \\ngranted to copy this without restriction.\\n\\nMichael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an\\ninformal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.\\nACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and\\nInternational Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the\\ncompany is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that\\nhis daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.\\n\\nThe concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga\\nto visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,\\nwho happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which \\nthe king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,\\nHis Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought\\nthere probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous\\nsatellite slots.  While this isn\\'t entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,\\nseeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of\\nslots.\\n\\nThe whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\\nHilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions\\nsupporting Tonga\\'s case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from \\n70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).\\nAccording to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\\nworld because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and \\nthe Pacific Rim. \\n\\nRIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax\\nhaven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to\\nfill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have\\ncost approximately $2 billion.  It\\'s not easy to raise that kind of money.\\nEventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began \\nnegotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in \\nMoscow in such harsh terms that I don\\'t think I\\'ll visit there for a long time.\\nBesides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way\\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everything.\"  \\nEveryone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the\\nonly ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\\n\\nEventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost\\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\\nsays that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who \\nwent to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was\\nout of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He\\nagain described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,\\nhe worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the \\nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions\\nbefore signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to \\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.\\n\\nThe next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied \\nMechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in \\nSiberia (can\\'t figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built\\nabout 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that\\nsiberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest\\npeople who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this\\npoint there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on\\nboth siberians and midwesterners :-)\\n\\nSternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is \\napparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that\\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \\nspecifications, they\\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites\\nthat RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This\\ncompares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1\\nmillion compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their \\nsatellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They \\nhave the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give\\nyou their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are\\ngetting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place\\nnow.\\n\\nTidbits:\\n\\n*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big\\nbusiness because big business is just like what they have over there, except\\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\\n\\n*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch\\nwithin 9 months.\\n\\n*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement\\nfund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,\\nand a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is\\nsort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.\\n\\n*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried\\npartly because we aren\\'t used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying\\nmonolith.  Italy gets a new government \"every two weeks\" but we don\\'t worry \\nbecause we\\'re used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what\\nreally goes on in Russia we won\\'t worry about their stability as much.\\n\\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering\\nmoney.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting\\n25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \\nrubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian\\nbank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that\\nthe only the contractors get swindled by the government.\\n\\n*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western \\nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type\\nof satellites, which was rather reassuring.\\n\\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have\\na lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much \\nshorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the \\ndifference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,\\nshorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\\nhardware.\\n\\n-- \\nJosh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu\\n\\t\\t    \"Find a way or make one.\"\\n\\t             -attributed to Hannibal\\n',\n",

Covey\" <covey+@andrew.cmu.edu>\\nSubject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks\\nDate: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)\\n\\n\\nFolks,\\n\\nHail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal\\ncarried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled \"Armed Force.\"  I\\nfelt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat\\nthat \"A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.\"  I sent\\nthe following to the WSJ.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nGun Stats & Mortal Risks\\n\\nPreston K. Covey\\n\\n\\n\\tErik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~\\n2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns\\nin the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King\\nCounty, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more\\nlikely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to\\nkill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it\\nhas grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated\\nby one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of\\nthe finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine\\n(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping\\nfirearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ \\n \\n\\tResponsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of\\nbringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: \\nWhat exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither\\nthe whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the\\nrisks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control\\ndo we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of\\ncancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the\\nrisks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful\\nhere. \\n\\n\\tThe NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us\\noff.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a\\nmisleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice\\nand terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far\\noutweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your\\ncar were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or\\nan innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not\\ntake the bus?  \\n\\n\\tUncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company\\nof lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at\\nstake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:\\n\\n\\tThe ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the\\nnumber of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense\\n(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed\\nby a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation\\nis 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other\\ncases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12\\naccidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided\\nby 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King\\nCounty between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of\\nhomes unaccounted.\\n\\n\\tThe NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on\\nsix counts:\\n\\n\\t1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or\\nacquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and\\nneighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is\\nthat the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,\\ndear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,\\nbut the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are\\nrelevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the\\ncalculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless\\nWaltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is\\ncriminological hogwash.\\n\\n\\t2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs\\npopulated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories\\n-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited\\nby more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities\\nlike drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is\\nvery low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but\\navoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with\\nhistories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and\\ncertifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious\\nrisk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as\\nignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither\\ngun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or\\nvehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver\\ncrucially affect the risk. \\n\\n\\t3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is\\nthat the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill\\nthan to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of\\npersonal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike\\nLarson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43\\ntimes as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun\\nViolence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this\\nparticular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about\\nwhether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by\\ntautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question\\nbegged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any\\ncase, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal\\ninstruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths\\nare personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility\\nobviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by\\ngun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to\\nNEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. \\nPeople have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their\\nhomes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection\\ncourse do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and\\nsober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death\\nas do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard\\nand obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they\\ndisregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and\\nother risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we\\nresent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose\\nnorms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign\\nus to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in\\nthe matter.\\n\\n\\t4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the\\nNEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,\\nincluding those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total\\ndeath toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other\\nstudies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from\\nhomicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these\\nsuicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true\\nthat attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously\\ntrue that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these\\nsuicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of\\nresearch on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is\\nwishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce\\nL. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,\\n1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of\\nPsychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of\\nthe NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to\\n~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the\\ncauses, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a\\nprofoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally\\ndisregard this issue.\\n\\n\\t5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable\\nrate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the\\nNEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. \\nBut many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled\\nself-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case\\ndispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of\\njustifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story\\non women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women\\nwho appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,\\n1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic\\ncases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were\\nreported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported\\nthat 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In\\nTime~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error\\nby a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged\\nby promulgators of the NEJM statistic. \\n\\n\\t6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation\\nare arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The\\ndivisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not\\naggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even\\nshot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the\\ncoin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy\\nis it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure\\nthe utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as\\nopposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or\\ndeterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where\\nno human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed\\nto media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the\\ncompendious research on successful armed defense, notably by\\ncriminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,\\nAldine de Gruyter, 1992)?\\n\\tKleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are\\nbased on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is\\nhigh (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare\\nbetter than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance\\nor those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year\\nby 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and\\naccidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable\\nstatistic than the NEJM scare stat:  \\n\\nA gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or\\nother crime than to kill anybody.   \\n\\n\\tOf course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;\\nwhat is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We\\nshould indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation\\nof defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. \\nClearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by\\nuncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we\\ncan hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we\\nhardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.\\n\\n-- \\nLarry Cipriani -- l.v.cipriani@att.com\\n',\n",

Answers to some frequently asked questions:\\n \\n Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?\\n A: Most of the team during the 40-50\\'s was made up of people who lived in \\nand around Montreal. Hence they were called \"Les Habitants\" (natives of \\nMontreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.\\n \\n Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?\\n A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to \\nsignify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer \\nexisted and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.\\n\\n Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?\\n A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is \\na weekly journal with up-to-date info.\\nPhone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)\\nPhone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)\\n \\n Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in \\nthe NHL?\\n A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 \\nchances.\\n \\n Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?\\n A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when \\na goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a \\n+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-\\nhanded goals do count for +/-.\\n \\n Q: What is the five-hole?\\n A: The space between a goalie\\'s pads. There are five major scoring zones: \\n(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower \\nright, and (5) five-hole.\\n \\n Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?\\n A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950\\'s when two best-of-seven \\nseries were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a \\ngame, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.\\n\\n Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?\\n A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever \\nto play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for \\nthe expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis \\nBlues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat \\nExpo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine \\nshots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately \\nlost the game, 6-4.\\n\\n Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?\\n A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed \\nthe richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be \\nworth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 \\nmillion a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.\\n\\n Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?\\n A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National \\nBasketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey \\nLeague, Friday, December 11, 1992.

A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell \\nUniversity in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.\\n\\n Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?\\n A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and \\nColonial Hockey Leagues.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n \\n9.

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\\nproperly.\\n\\n2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test\\nand a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were\\nperformed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter\\nantenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis\\nis in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed\\ninformation relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.\\n\\n3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to\\n264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\\n\\n4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)\\nadvanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone\\n70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees\\nto 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.\\n\\n5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change\\n(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance\\nmeasurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC\\nmeasurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and\\ncurrently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with\\nthe model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.\\n\\n6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:\\n\\n       a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts\\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees\\n           off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading)\\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\\n           acceptable range\\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\\n           Time To Initiation - 184 hours\\n\\n\\nTRAJECTORY\\n\\n     As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\\nstatus was as follows:\\n\\n\\tDistance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU)\\n\\tDistance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU)\\n\\tHeliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour\\n\\tDistance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km\\n\\tRound Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds\\n\\n\\nSPECIAL TOPIC\\n\\n1.  As of April 22, 1993, a total of 70185 real-time commands have been\\ntransmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65077  were initiated in the\\nsequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process.\\nIn the past week, one real time command was transmitted: one was initiated in\\nthe sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command\\nprocess.

Even though publicly they say that they support the Greek\\ncause, practically they not only do nothing, but instead, using some usual\\n\"reasoning\" and other crap rhetoric as a pretext, they gradually\\nbackup Kemal (who had given now to the British \"water and bread\" that\\nhe will dissolve the superethnic Ottoman and contract it into a small\\nethnic-state). The main drive behind this British switch was the plan\\nto keep a Muslim state in the region as buffer against a Russian expansion\\ninto warm-water facilities. The \"greek empire\" being an Orthodox Christian\\nstate was too prone to become Russian client.\\n\\nOut of this intrigue, the current state of affairs was established on our\\nlands. While Venizelos and Kemal were promoted as true \"Giants\" by the\\nBritish, since they worked to realize their goals in the region.\\nUnder the same plan, currently Greece and Turkey are recipients of big\\nmilitary funds from the US; both they are functioning as anti-Russian\\nbuffers, while simultaneously both remain good clients of State Dept. because\\notherwise the use of terror of changing \"the balance of power in the Aegean\"\\nwill be used.\\n\\nUnder the same exact rational you should see the Cyprus problem.\\n\\nGr\\n\\nPS: I don\\'t make any anti-...whatever rhetoric.

[1]\\n\\nBorn 1964\\nSecretary-Typist\\nAzsantekmontazh Trust\\nSumgait Construction and Installation Administration\\nSecretary of the SMU Komsomol Organization\\n\\nResident at Building 17/33B, Apartment 15\\nMicrodistrict No. 3\\nSumgait [Azerbaijan]\\n\\n\\nOn the 27th my sister Marina and I went to the movies the seven o\\'clock show,\\nat the theater that is across from the City Party Committee, about 50 yards \\naway. The SK theater. They were showing an Argentinian film, \"The Abyss.\" \\nBefore the film we noticed about 60 to 70 people standing near the podium at \\nthe City Party Committee, but they were silent, there\\'s no conversation \\nwhatsoever, and we couldn\\'t figure out what was going on. That is, we knew it \\nwas about Karabagh, but what it was exactly, what they were talking about, if \\nsomeone gave a speech or not, we didn\\'t know. We bought our tickets. There \\nwere 30 or 40 people in the theater. This was a very small number for that \\nlarge movie theater. The film started. About 30 minutes later they stopped the\\nfilm. A crowd burst in. About 60 people. They came up onto the stage. Well \\nmostly they were young people, from 16 to 23 years old. They demanded that an \\nArmenian woman come up onto the stage. They used foul language and said that \\nthey were going to show what Azerbaijanis were capable of, what they could do \\nto Armenian girls. I thought that\\'s what they meant because they had demanded \\na girl specifically. Marina and I were sitting together. I told her to move \\nover, there were some Russian girls sitting nearby. So that if someone \\nrecognized me or if something happened, they would take me, and not Marina. \\nIt got quiet, 2 or 3 girls jumped up to run out, but the door was closed--it\\'s\\nonly opened at the end of the   show--and they returned to their seats. \\nEveryone in the theater was looking at one another, Russians, Azerbaijanis, \\npeople of various nationalities. But no one reacted at all, no one in the \\nauditorium made a sound. They were silent, looking at one another, and \\ngradually started to leave. Some guy, a really fat one, says, \"OK, we\\'ve \\nscared them enough, let\\'s leave.\" They leave slowly, pompously. It seemed to \\nme that those people were not themselves. Either they had smoked a bunch of \\n\"anasha\", or had taken something else, because they all looked beastly, like \\nthey were ready to tear anyone apart. Then it was all over, as though nothing \\nhad happened at all. The film started up again, it was one of those cheerful \\nfilms which should have only brought pleasure, made you happy to be alive. We \\ncould barely sit to the end. So it had started at seven it was over by nine, \\nand it was dark . . .\\n\\nMarina and I were walking home, Lenin Street, that\\'s the center of town. Lenin\\nStreet was packed, just packed with young people. They were shouting, \\nsomething about Karabagh and something about Armenians. We weren\\'t especially \\nlistening, because the way we were feeling we didn\\'t know if we were going to \\nmake it home or not, and just what had happened anyway? Public transportation \\nwasn\\'t running. Incidentally, when we came out of the theater we saw police, \\npolicemen standing there. The director of the movie theater was looking at the\\ndoors, because when they were leaving they had broken the glass, the doors \\nthere are basically all glass. Everything was broken. He stood there grief-\\nstricken, but looking as though nothing really big had happened, like some \\nnaughty boys had just broken them quite by accident, with a slingshot. Well, \\nsince he looked more or less calm I decided that, nothing all that super \\nserious had happened. We went out very slowly; we wanted to catch a bus, we \\nlive literally one stop away. We didn\\'t want to go on foot, not because it was\\ndark, but because something might happen. We flagged down a cab, but the \\ndriver didn\\'t want to take us. We told him we live near the bus station, and \\nhe said he\\'d take us to the bus station and not a yard farther. I said, well, \\nOK . . .\\n\\nSo we got into the cab and managed to get there. Something incredible was \\nhappening at the bus station. There was a traffic jam. Public transportation \\nwas at a standstill and everyone was shouting \"Ka-ra-bagh,\" they\\'re not going \\nto give up Karabagh. I go home and tell my family what\\'s going on, and there\\'s\\nimmediate panic in the house. Mamma says, what should we do? Like the end had \\ncome, they were going to come, kill us, that\\'s it . . . Somehow we managed to \\ncheer ourselves up: Nothing that bad could happen. Where are we living anyway,\\njust what kind of social order do we have? Somehow we manage to calm Mamma \\ndown. And we went to bed. But no one could sleep. Everyone made as though \\nnothing had happened.\\n\\nThat was on Saturday. In short, the day went by. We didn\\'t go anywhere and \\ndidn\\'t call our relatives. No one did anything. Because . . . life goes on.\\nThat day I realized something was approaching, but what exactly, I couldn\\'t\\nguess.\\n\\nOn the 28th everything was like it was supposed to be, we lived like we always\\nhad. There were five of us at home: Mamma, Papa and us, three sisters: Lyuda, \\nMarina, and I. My sister Lyuda was in Yerevan at the time. We sat at home and \\nno one went out. Later we learned that a demonstration had started that \\nmorning. It all started . . . They were smashing up stores. We were sitting at\\nhome and didn\\'t know anything about it. Then a girlfriend of mine, Lyuda \\nZimogliad, came by at around three o\\'clock I think. We worked together, we did\\nour apprenticeships together, she\\'s a Russian girl. She said that something\\nawful was happening in town. I asked, \"Don\\'t they want Armenians? Well what \\nare they after, if they\\'re already in that state?\" She says, no, nothing like \\nthat, it\\'s just a demonstration, but it\\'s awful to watch it. Somehow, it feels\\nlike a war has broken out. Public transportation has been stopped . . . The \\ncabs, the buses, well it\\'s just a nightmare.\\n\\nThen Papa decides to go to the drugstore, my mother was having allergy \\nproblems at the time . . . He left the house and our neighbor, Aunt Vera,\\nasked him, \"Where are you going? Stop! There are such terrible things going\\non in the courtyard; aren\\'t you afraid to go out?\" Papa didn\\'t know what she\\nwas talking about. She simply pushed him back into the entryway. He came home \\nand told Mamma. Mamma said, \"Well, if Aunt Vera was talking like that it means\\nthat something is really going on.\" But we didn\\'t go see her, she\\'s a Russian,\\nshe lives across from us. I had to see my friend out. Around five o\\'clock I \\ntell Lyuda, \"Ok, look, it\\'s time for you to go, it\\'s late already, I\\'ll see \\nyou out.\" Mamma says, \"You don\\'t need to go, it\\'s too late already, you can \\nsee what the situation in town is.\" So we decided to stay home. Dinner was \\nready. Mamma says, \"Let her eat with us, then she can go.\" We sat down at the \\ntable. But no one was hungry, no one was in the mood, we just put everything \\nout on the table to calm ourselves down, and make it appear that we\\'re eating.\\nWe turned on the television, and the show \"In Fairy-Tale Land\" was coming on. \\nWe cleared the table.\\n\\nWe hear some noise out in the courtyard. I go out on the balcony, but I can\\'t \\nsee what\\'s going on, because the noise is coming from the direction of the bus\\nstation, and there is a 9-story building in the way. There is mob of people \\n. . . I can\\'t figure out what\\'s happening. They\\'re shouting something, looking\\nsomewhere, I can\\'t make out what is going on. I go down to a neighbor, she\\'s \\nan Azerbaijani; we\\'ve been friends of her family for about 25 years. I go down\\nto look from their place. I see people shouting, looking at the 5-and 9-story \\nbuildings near the bus station. Just then soldiers set upon them, about 20 \\npeople, with clubs. The mob runs off in different directions. I even see \\nseveral people from our building. They are looking and laughing . . . I decide\\nthat means it\\'s not all that bad if they are laughing: it means they\\'re not \\nkilling anyone. But now the crowd suddenly dashes toward the soldiers. One of \\nthe soldiers cannot manage to get away, they start stomping on him with their \\nfeet, everyone\\'s kicking him . . . I become ill and go home, and explain in \\ngeneral terms that horrible things are going on out there . . .  can\\'t speak\\n. . . Well, they\\'ve probably killed that soldier, the way that crowd is . . .\\nIf each of them kicked him just once . . . They took his club away from him\\nand started to beat him with it. But it was far away and I couldn\\'t see if he\\ngot up and left or not.\\n\\nI become terrified and go home and say, \"Lyuda, don\\'t go anywhere, stay at our\\nplace, because if you go out they could kill you or . . . \" Then the crowd \\nruns over closer toward our building and stands at the 12-story building and \\nstarts shouting something. We go out onto the balcony. All of our neighbors \\nare also out on theirs, too. Everyone is standing, staring. The mob is \\nshouting and about 5 minutes later comes running toward our building. As it \\nturns out, at the 12-story building the Azerbaijani neighbors went down and \\nkept them from coming in. There\\'s only one entryway there, they could stop \\nthem.\\n\\nThey all run up to our building. Mamma immediately starts closing the windows,\\nafraid that they might throw stones. They have stones and they break the \\nwindows, all of them. There are very many people. We have a large courtyard, \\nand it\\'s packed with people. They spill up to the first floor so they don\\'t \\ncrush each other. They crawl up on trees, posts, and garages. It\\'s just a huge\\ncloud of people. They break and burn the motorcycle of the Armenian Sergey \\nSargisian, from our building. We close the windows and immediately hear \\ntramping in our entryway. They come up to our fifth floor with a tremendous \\ndin and roar. It\\'s incomprehensible. Mamma told me later that they were \\nshouting Father\\'s name, \"Grisha, open the door, we\\'ve come to kill you!,\" or\\nsomething like that. I don\\'t remember that, I was spaced out, kind of. Mamma \\nsays, \"Into the bedroom, quickly!\" In the bedroom we have two tall beds, part \\nof our dowry; Mamma says, \"Hide there, they probably won\\'t come in there, \\nthey\\'ll ask something, say something, and leave.\" She says, \"We\\'ll tell them \\nthat we live alone here.\" I can\\'t imagine that my parents will stand out in \\nthe hall alone talking with some sort of beasts . . . I go to them and say \\nthat I\\'ll stand together with them, I\\'ll talk with them if they come, maybe I \\ncan find a common language with them, all the more so if they know me: I speak \\nAzerbaijani more or less, and I can find out what they want. I told Marina and\\nLyuda to hide under the bed, and my sister Lyuda, I can\\'t remember if I told \\nher anything or not.\\n\\nThen . . . they open the door: it\\'s like they blew on it and it broke and fell\\nright into the hall. The crows bursts in and starts to shout: Get out of here,\\nleave, vacate the apartment and go back to your Armenia; things like that. I\\ntell them, \"What has happened, speak calmly. One of you, tell me, calmly, what\\nhas happened.\" In Azerbaijani, they say, \"Get out of the apartment, leave.\" I \\nsay, \"OK. Go downstairs. We\\'ll gather everything we need and leave the \\napartment.\" I realize that it is senseless to discuss any sort of rights with\\nthem, these are animals. They must be stopped. The ones standing in the\\ndoorway, the young guys, say, \"There are old people and one girl with them.\\nToo bad!\" They take two or three steps back. It seems as though I have\\npacified them with our exchange. Then someone in the courtyard shouts, \\ncommanding them: \"Don\\'t you understand what you are saying? Kill them?\"\\n\\nAnd that was it! That was all it took. They grab Papa, carry him into one\\nroom, and Mamma and me into another. They put Mamma on the bed and start \\nundressing her, beating her legs. They start tearing my clothes, right there, \\nin front of Mamma. I don\\'t remember where they went, what they did, or how \\nmuch time passed. I had the feeling that they beat me on the head, on my body,\\nand tore my clothes, all at the same time, I don\\'t even know what I said. The \\natrocities started. I was savagely raped in that room. They argued among \\nthemselves who would go first.\\n\\nLater, I remember, I came to. I don\\'t know if I\\'m dead or alive. Someone comes\\nin, someone tall, I think, clean-shaven, in an Eskimo dogskin coat, balding. \\nHe looks around at what\\'s happening. At that instant everything stops. It \\nseems to me that he is either their commander or . . . that somehow everything\\ndepends on him. He looks and says, \"Well, we\\'re done here.\" They are beating\\nMamma on the head. They break up the chairs and beat her with the chair legs \\n. . . She loses consciousness, and they decide that she\\'s dead. Papa . . . was\\nout cold. They want to throw Lyuda off the balcony, but they can\\'t get the \\nwindow open. Apparently the window frames are stuck after the rain and the \\nwindows can\\'t be opened. They leave her next to the window. She was thinking \\nabout being thrown out the window and passed out. She\\'s not a real strong \\nperson anyway . . . He looks at me and sees that I\\'m saying something, that\\nI\\'m still twitching. Well, I start saying the opposite of what I should be, \\nwhich is humbling myself and pleading. I start shouting, cursing . . . they \\ndon\\'t get any entreaty out of me. I  already know that I\\'m dead, why would I \\nhumble myself before anyone? And he says that if that\\'s what I think, since my\\ntongue is so long . . . maybe he thinks that I still look quite appealing \\n. . . In short, he commands that I be taken outside.\\n\\nI no longer saw or remembered what was happening to Marina and Lyuda, I don\\'t \\nknow if they are alive or not. They take me outside. They are dragging me by \\nmy arms, by my legs. They are hitting me against the wall, the railings, \\nsomething metal . . . While they are carrying me someone is biting me, someone\\nelse is pinching me . . .I don\\'t even know. I think, my God, when will death \\ncome? If only it were sooner . . . Then . . . they carry me out, throw me near\\nthe entryway . . . and start kicking me. I lose consciousness . . . What \\nhappened after that, how many people there were, I don\\'t remember.\\n \\nI come to after a while, I don\\'t remember how long. A neighbor is bringing me \\nclothing. I\\'m entirely covered with blood, she puts a dress on me. I remember \\nthat I said the same words over and over again: \"Mamma, what happened, Mamma, \\nwhat have they done to us, where are we, whose house are we at?\" I can\\'t make \\nsense out of anything. There is a guy standing over me, I sort of know him, he\\nserved in Afghanistan, his name is Igor, he brought me indoors. When they all \\nwent to the third entryway and killed a person there, Igor gathered his \\ncourage, took me into his arms, and brought me to the neighbors\\', even though \\nhe\\'s small-minded, he put himself at risk. Igor Agayev is Azerbaijani; he \\nserved in Afghanistan. There are three brothers. The older brother also served\\nthere, I think; now he\\'s stationed here, on the border, in Armenia. Igor \\nbrought me to the neighbors\\', and then helped me come to my senses, saying, \\n\"Karina, I know you, calm down, I\\'m not one of them.\" How do I know who\\'s who \\nand what\\'s what? I come to, and they clean me up. I was covered in blood. Then\\nPapa . . . I saw Papa, I saw Mamma. And Marina, too . . . Igor was there when \\nthey dragged Marina and Lyuda out from under the bed . . . Marina . . . Lyuda \\nsaid that she was Russian, they said, we\\'ll let you go, we aren\\'t touching the\\nRussians, go. And while they are dragging Marina out she decides she\\'s going \\nto tell them she\\'s Azerbaijani. Igor immediately grabs Marina\\'s and Lyuda\\'s \\nhands, because he knows Marina, and knows that she is Armenian and is our \\nsister, and takes her to the second floor to a neighbor\\'s and starts pounding \\non the door so she will open up. She opens the door and Igor pushes them in \\nthere. So they survived.\\n\\nMy sister Lyuda lost consciousness after the bandits started stealing things.\\nWhile they were going downstairs, taking things downstairs, then coming back \\nup again, Lyuda seized the opportunity and crawled under the bed and stayed \\nthere. Then, when she was herself again, she found a torn night shirt and put \\nit on, and some sort of robe and went to a neighbor\\'s on the fourth floor, the\\none whose apartment I had watched the crowd from, the friend of ours, and \\nknocked on the door. The neighbor opened and said, \"I\\'m not going to let you \\nin the apartment because I\\'m afraid of them. But I\\'ll give you some stockings \\nand we\\'ll leave the building.\" Lyuda says, \"I\\'ll stay at your place because of\\nwhat\\'s going on, they keep going up and down the stairs.\" It was just for a \\nmoment, just a moment in life, but the neighbor wouldn\\'t consent. Lyuda came \\nback to our place and lay under the bed . . .\\n\\nI came to. Mother was there. I can\\'t remember my supervisor\\'s telephone \\nnumber, but something had to be done. Somehow I remembered and called, and he \\ncame to get us. He didn\\'t have any idea what was going on. He thought we were \\nsimply afraid, he didn\\'t know that they were killing us and that we had passed\\nbetween life and death. He came and got us and took us to the police precinct.\\nThere they looked us over. I was having trouble walking, my lungs hurt badly, \\nit was hard to breathe . . .\\n\\nMy supervisor\\'s name is Urshan Feyruzovich Mamedov. He\\'s the head of our \\nadministration. They took us there. When we were leaving, I saw a great number\\nof buses full of soldiers at the entrance to town. The buses were ordinary \\npassenger buses. There were very many soldiers. We left around eleven, right \\nafter eleven. If these people could stop what was happening they could save a \\ngreat many lives . . . Because the crowd was moving on, toward the school, and\\nwhat was going on there . . . I think everyone know not only in Sumgait, not \\nonly in Yerevan. Because there they murdered them all one after the next, \\nwithout stopping. After us.\\n\\nI think 14 people died in Microdistrict No. 3, and 10 to 12 of them were from\\nBuildings 4, 5, and 6. In our building one person died, and one old woman died\\nfrom Building 16, that\\'s the building in front of ours. There young \\nAzerbaijani men stopped the mob and wouldn\\'t let it into their building. \\nIncidentally, when we were at the neighbors\\', Marina called our relatives\\nto warn them, so they would all know what was happening. I called a aunt in \\nMicrodistrict No. 5. They have three neighbors who are Armenians. I said, \"Run\\nquickly, I can\\'t explain what\\'s going on; hide, do what you can, just stay\\nalive. Hide at Azerbaijanis\\', ones who won\\'t give you away.\" At that moment \\nthree people came in, policemen. I think they were Azerbaijanis. I was in such\\nawful condition, my face was completely distorted my lips were puffed up, \\nthere was blood, my eye was swollen, no one thought I would ever see anything \\nout of that eye again . . . my forehead was badly cut, and one-half of my face\\nwas pushed out forward. No one would have thought that I would survive, get my\\nnormal appearance back, and be able to grasp anything at all. I started to \\nscream at those people, why did you come, who sent you here, no one wants you \\nhere, haven\\'t you killed people people yet, what are you doing here? One of \\nthe soldiers said, \"Don\\'t scream at us. We\\'re Muslims, but we\\'re not from the \\nSumgait police. They called in from Daghestan.\" So at that point the \\nDaghestan police were there.\\n\\nWhen we got to the police precinct there were an awful lot of police there,\\nthere were soldiers, police with dogs, ambulances, firemen . . . I don\\'t know,\\nmaybe they were waiting for people to bring them the goners and the seriously \\ninjured to treat them there in the police precinct. I don\\'t know what they \\nwere there for. There were also doctors from Baku there. They examined Lyuda \\nand me and said, \"These women need to go to the Maternity Home, but we don\\'t \\nknow what to do with the rest.\"\\n\\nSo they took us, and I lost contact with my parents, my boss, everyone. My \\nboss said, \"Don\\'t worry, I\\'ll find you, no matter where you are, no matter\\nwhat happens.\" We went to the hospital. There we were examined by a department\\nhead from the Sumgait Maternity Home, Pashayeva, I think her name was. She \\nexamined us. The ambulance was from Baku; I figured out that the Sumgait \\nambulances hadn\\'t done anything, they didn\\'t respond to any calls. People \\ncalled and neither the police nor the ambulances showed any sign of life.\\n\\nThat doctor looked me over and I could tell from her behavior that something\\nvery good had happened, for she became quite glad. I even thought to myself, \\n\"God, can it be that nothing all that bad is wrong?\" She looks me over and \\nsays, \"Now why are you suffering so? You don\\'t know what your people have been\\ndoing, your people did even worse things.\" And I think, great, I have to deal \\nwith her . . . And I felt so bad, I thought, why don\\'t I just die so as not to\\nhave to hear more stuff like this from people like her? Here I am in this \\ncondition and being told about something that our people did. I just didn\\'t \\nhave the energy to say, \"How could our people possibly be smart enough to \\nthink of something that yours haven\\'t already done?\" I stayed there. Then they\\nbrought in another woman, Ira B., she was married, and she was raped in her \\nown apartment, too. There were three of us, Ira, Lyuda, and 1. The next \\nmorning they took Lyuda and Ira away. They didn\\'t do anything to help us. This\\nwas in the old Maternity Home, in the combined block. They didn\\'t do anything \\nmore than examine me, that was it. I didn\\'t want any shots or tranquilizer, \\nnothing. What shots could have calmed me down? I didn\\'t even want to look at \\nthem.\\n\\nI lay in the ward. Either it just worked out that way or they did it on pur-\\npose, but I was alone. I was alone even though the wards were packed. That\\nsame evening a woman came by and asked me what was wrong with me, that my face\\nwas disfigured. She asked what had happened to me, and I said, \"Better to ask \\nyour brother what happened, there\\'s no point in asking me, your brother can \\nbetter explain what happened.\" She fell into a faint. All the doctors threw \\nthemselves at her, and the doctor categorically forbade anyone to come into my\\nward.\\n\\nThen people from work came to see me, my boss, his daughter; they brought me \\nclothing, because I was literally naked. The only thing I had on was a dress, \\nbut the woman who gave it to me was very short, and the dress was way up \\nabove my knees, and the woman orderly said, \"I can\\'t believe you put on such a\\nshort dress, who are you showing off your legs to here?\" I went back to my \\nward thinking, just one more thing from something. People from work came and \\nbrought me something in a sack, apples, I think, three or four pounds, but I \\ncouldn\\'t take them. I had become so weak that it was just embarrassing. I said\\nthat I couldn\\'t take the apples, and really didn\\'t have any appetite. No one \\nhad to bring me anything. Some woman took the sack . . . And, oh yes! . . . \\nThen I heard that the head doctor tell a nurse that my medical history should \\nbe hidden or torn up completely so that no one would know that I was an \\nArmenian, maybe they wouldn\\'t figure it out from looking at me. So they must \\nhave been thinking that there would be some kind of attack, that something \\nelse would happen. That it would be worse. Or, perhaps, someone was outside on\\nthe street, I don\\'t know. In any case, I didn\\'t sleep a wink that night.\\n\\nThe next morning they picked me up, a whole police detail, put me in a bus, \\nand off we went. I didn\\'t even know where they were taking me. They took me to\\nthe club where the troops were, the very one I was in that ill-fated evening.\\nI got off the bus. Near the City Party Committee there were a great many \\ntroops, tanks, armored personnel carriers; the whole scene was terrible. I saw \\na few people I knew there, and that calmed me a little. I had already thought \\nthat I was the only one left. So there were five or six of us left in Sumgait \\nafter that night. I still didn\\'t know what happened to my parents, they didn\\'t \\ncome to see me in the hospital, and my boss told me that everything was fine. \\nI didn\\'t know whether to believe him or not. Maybe he was just trying to calm \\nme down, maybe something happened on the way. Then I went to the club and saw \\na lot of people I knew. They all knew one another, they were all kissing each \\nother and asking, \"What happened, what went on?\" Two days later they came to \\nsee me from work. They were there all the time. Each day they came, showed \\ninterest, and were constantly bringing me money. They did everything they \\ncould. Of course I\\'m most thankful to my boss, the only one of my colleagues \\nwho didn\\'t lose his presence of mind and who didn\\'t change his opinions, \\nneither before, nor after, nor in the heat of the moment, no matter what \\nhappened. He constantly took an interest. A sincere interest, from the heart \\n. . . Then, about two days later, the secretary of the Party Committee came, \\nnot from our Party organization, but from the First Trust, which ours is part \\nof, Comrade Kerimov, a very important figure in our town. He made arrangements\\nwith the emergency medical personnel to take me away, because if I sat down by\\nmyself I couldn\\'t get up or lie down again. There was something wrong with my\\nlungs, it was hard to breathe. They examined me there several times, there I \\nlay were several doctors, they all thought that . . . that it must just be \\nfrom all the blows, I don\\'t know. They didn\\'t diagnose anything in particular.\\nWhen I was in the Maternity Home I even asked . . . I made it a point of \\ninsisting that they take me to the trauma section because I felt so awful. \\nThere was no way something inside wasn\\'t broken, my ribs . . . Well they took \\nme there and took x-rays and said that everything was fine. There were \\nemergency medical workers on duty in the club. The mother of one of Marina\\'s \\nfriends was there. She was the head doctor at the Sumgait Children\\'s Clinic. \\nThey had every kind of antifever agent in the world, which was exactly what I\\nneeded at that moment, I thought. I said that I was having great difficulty\\nbreathing, I couldn\\'t seem to get enough air, something was wrong with me.\\nThey put tight bandages around my chest and waist. Later I overheard some\\npeople saying that I had been cut all over. I think they just saw me being all\\nbandaged up and decided that my breasts and face had been cut . . . But I\\nwasn\\'t cut.\\n\\nThey took us to the Khimik boarding house. We lived there a long time. Soon \\nappeared representatives . . . They were agitating. At first people would not \\ntalk to them, and drove them off. One of the Armenian women shouted, \"We \\ndemand that Seidov come!\" The response was, \"It\\'s Seidov who sent us.\" Seidov \\nis the Chairman of the Azerbaijani Council of Ministers. The woman said, \\n\"We\\'ll only see Seidov\\'s daughter, have her come here, we\\'ll do the same \\nthings to her that they did to our daughters, and then we\\'ll deal with you \\nagitators.\" And so on. More of them said, \"Have Seidov himself come.\" This \\nwent on day in, day out. The agitators kept coming and coming, this drove us \\nout of our wits. Then people gradually started departing for Yerevan because \\nthey realized it was senseless to stay. Everything got on our nerves: The \\nsmell, the small children. There were children at the SK club, children who \\nhad literally just come out of the Maternity Home. What were they doing in a \\nclub that didn\\'t even have running water all the time? At first we had to pay \\nto eat there. They even overcharged us, as it turned out. On the second day \\nsomeone told us that they would bring us food for free. The children were ill.\\nEverything stank there. Well imagine about 3,000 people in a small movie \\ntheater with seating for no more than 500. You couldn\\'t sit or lie down, it \\nwas impossible to even move. The stench was awful. Even the smallest infants \\ntook ill overnight there. I heard that they were arriving seriously ill in \\nYerevan, the infants. They have to be washed, they have to be bathed, not to \\nmention that we, the adults, were ill and needed care. People were fainting \\nright and left. I just don\\'t know, everyone was crying, everyone . . . Only \\nthe young people, the men, somehow managed to keep it together. But the women \\nwere in a constant state of panic. It seemed to everyone that they would come \\nany minute and kill and stab. It seemed clear that we had been gathered \\ntogether purposely, like during the war, so that they could burn the movie \\ntheater and there wouldn\\'t be a single Armenian left. Then people went up to \\nthe attic. I didn\\'t see them, I only heard them, because I was lying down and \\ncouldn\\'t get up. I lay right on the stage, we had some room there. Apparently \\nthey caught two people with either oil or gas. I think they wanted to burn the\\ntheater. Maybe someone saw them, I didn\\'t. I was in no condition to open my \\neyes.\\n\\nEveryone was suspicious of everyone else. They would ask, \"Aren\\'t you an \\nAzerbaijani? I think I saw you somewhere, I think you\\'re an Azerbaijani.\" They\\nled out all the men and started letting them back in by checking their\\npassports, relatives might be covering for each other. Half of the people did\\nnot have any documents. There were people who had run out of their homes in \\nnothing but a pair of pants and slippers, or wearing just a shirt, not like\\nthey should have, with their IDs.\\n\\nSo on the 28th, on Sunday, I think, the police did nothing to help us. On\\nMonday everything resumed where it had left off on Block 41A. They didn\\'t \\nspare a soul there: not children, not pregnant women, nobody. They killed,\\nthey burned, they hacked with axes, just everything possible. They murdered \\nthe Melkumian family whom I knew, my mother worked with them. Their daughter-\\nin-law went to school with my older sister. They were brutally murdered. Only \\nthe two daughters-in-law survived. By a miracle one was able to save herself, \\nshe ran away, the neighbors wouldn\\'t take her in, so she ran about the \\nbuilding until she found refuge. She was pregnant and had two small children. \\nThis all continued on Monday in Block 41A, on the 29th, when the troops were \\nalready in the city.\\n\\nThey murdered people, they overturned automobiles, and they burned entire \\nfamilies. They say they didn\\'t even know for sure if the people were Armenians\\nor not. I heard that the Lezgins suffered, too. I\\'m not sure myself, I didn\\'t \\nsee any Lezgins who had been injured. They burned cars so it\\'s very difficult \\nnow to say exactly who died and who didn\\'t. It was very difficult to identify \\nthe corpses, or rather, what remained of the corpses after they were doused in\\ngasoline and burned . . . it\\'s all very hard to imagine, of course I heard \\nthat many people disappeared without a trace, from the BTZ plant two people, \\nincluding a woman who worked the night shift, Aunt Razmella, who also lived in\\nMicrodistrict 3.\\n\\nThey were stopping buses between Baku and Sumgait. In the evening people who \\nhad been visiting Baku were returning to Sumgait, and people from Baku were \\ngoing home from Sumgait, and there were students, too. They were simply \\nsavagely murdered. They were stopping the buses, the drivers immediately did \\nwhat they were told because there was just no other way to deal with that \\nhoard of brutally minded people. They stopped the buses, dragged the Armenians\\nout and killed them on the spot. I didn\\'t see it myself, but I heard that they\\nput them all in a pile so as to burn them. Later it was hard to discern from \\nthe corpses, well you can\\'t call them corpses, you had to figure out from the \\nashes who it was. l heard that two fellows saved two women, one a student, Ira\\nG., if I\\'m not mistaken. She was in the hospital a long time after that, and \\nshe still can\\'t figure out who saved her. She was also brutally raped and \\nbeaten and thrown onto a pile of corpses. The fellow pulled her out of that \\nwhole pile of corpses, put his coat on her, took her into his arms, and \\ncarried her to the city. I still can\\'t imagine how he managed to do that.\\n\\nI heard that from Engels Grigorian. He knows her, apparently. Well a lot of \\npeople went to that hospital anyway. She was in the hospital and singing a \\nsong in Armenian, and they wrote the words down, and, I think he still has \\nthat piece of paper, because he says that a lot of people now have that song, \\nthe one she sang in the hospital where she lay in such bad shape. They \\ncouldn\\'t find the guy who saved her. He left her in someone\\'s apartment and\\ncalled the ambulance, she was in such awful shape that, probably, like me,\\nshe couldn\\'t remember anyone\\'s face.\\n\\nI think that I knew one of the people who broke into our house, maybe I had \\ntalked with him once. But I received so many blows everything was just knocked\\nout of my head. I can\\'t remember to this day who he was. Then, it seems, I saw\\nthe Secretary of the Directorate\\'s Party organization, where Marina works. She\\ngoes to school and works, she goes to night school at AZI, and works by day at\\nthe Khimzashchita Construction and Installation Administration. I\\'m the \\nSecretary of the Komsomol organization at our administration and often met \\nwith the secretaries of Party and Komsomol organizations. We had joint \\nmeetings. I know them all, I\\'ve even talked with them, and he, I know, is from\\nArmenia. An Azerbaijani, but from Armenia. It became obvious that many of \\nthose people were Azerbaijanis born in Armenia.\\n\\nThey took me to various police stations, to the police precinct, and to the\\nProcuracy, because the USSR Procuracy got involved in the case, and I iden-\\ntified the photographs of people who I could more or less recognize. They\\nshowed me the people who were in our apartment, they\\'re working on our\\ncase, but I can\\'t even recognize them, although it was proved that they were\\nthe ones, they\\'re processing it somehow. They tell me that they know that\\nsomeone held me by the arm and someone else held me by the leg when they were \\ndragging me. There was someone else in our apartment who did not even touch \\nme, he just stole a blanket and an earring or something like that. All these \\npeople, all of them, as much as I\\'ve heard about them and seen them, they were\\nall from Kafan.\\n\\nThe Secretary of the Party organization is named Najaf, Najaf Rzayev. He was \\nthere when everything started. It must have been him because I didn\\'t \\nrecognize anyone else in the crowd whom I knew besides him. All the more since\\nI told him, \"Listen, you do something, because you know me.\" He turned away \\nand went toward the bedroom, where Marina was. Well you couldn\\'t see Marina \\nanyway. There was such a noisy confusion of people that you couldn\\'t make out \\nanyone. All of it flew right out of my head, and then gradually I became \\nmyself again, at the City Party Committee . . . There were military people \\nthere. I told them what went on, and they wrote it all down. I told them his \\nname. On March 8 the Secretary of our First Trust Party organization, the one \\nwe\\'re part of, came to see us, his name is Najaf Rzayev. I tell Mamma, \"If\\nhe\\'s here despite the fact that I gave his name, it means that either his \\nalibi has been confirmed or, probably, that they think I\\'m crazy, not \\nresponsible for my words.\" He said, \"What did they do to you, how awful, \\nmyself, I hid an Armenian family.\" Then after some time goes by he comes back \\nagain and says something entirely different: \"I wasn\\'t at home, my family and \\nI went to Baku.\" I said, \"Marina, what is he saying? He said something totally\\ndifferent before.\" After that I didn\\'t go to see our Procurator, our case is \\nbeing handled by a procurator from Voronezh, Fedorov by name. Fedorov told me \\nthat Rzayev\\'s case had just gotten to him, and there were so names involved. \\nWhat are they doing with Rzayev?\\nDid he prove his alibi or not? They just think that since I was hit in the \\nhead I can\\'t say anything for sure, whether it was him or not. It will be an \\ninsult if he was in our apartment and doesn\\'t have to pay for it, but at the \\nsame time\\n\\nI\\'m afraid to say I\\'m a hundred percent sure that it was he. Because no mat-\\nter who I name, they tell me, no, you\\'re wrong, he didn\\'t do that, that one\\nwasn\\'t there. All the faces have gotten mixed up in my mind. Who did what\\nexactly I can\\'t say.                                                     \\n\\nWhen they took me outside there was a whole crowd there, but I didn\\'t see it, \\nbecause I had my eyes closed all the time. It seemed to me that I always got\\nit because of my eyes, people were always hassling me, for some reason it \\nalways seemed to me that my eyes are responsible. When they were beating my \\nface I thought they were trying to put my eyes out. So I had my eyes closed, \\nthey took me outside and started to beat me. A young guy, 22, held my arms, he\\nworks at the BTZ plant. And right nearby, across the road from us, Block 41, \\nis where all this was going on. Right across the road from us. The BTZ \\ndormitory is over there, that\\'s where he lives. Now he\\'s in custody, they even\\nhave proved, as far as I know, that it was he who killed Shurik Gambarian, the\\nclarinet player from the third entryway of our building. One person in our \\nbuilding was killed, it was that man.\\n\\nA guy comes by who shared a room with the guy who was holding me. He saw that\\nhe was holding me by the arms and that he was beating me, but he didn\\'t come \\nover, he just looked and then went into the dormitory. A while after it was \\nall over, people started making announcements in town saying that \\ninvestigators had been summoned. That guy went and told them everything. Now \\nthey\\'ve caught him, everything\\'s been proved. Now, evidently, they\\'ve been\\nbeating him, I don\\'t know what they\\'re doing with them over there, but he \\nhimself said that he was working the night shift at the plant. Some young guy \\ncame to the plant and said, \"Everyone who wants to kill Armenians come to the \\nbus station on Saturday at ten.\" That was it. He said, the ones who wanted to,\\nwent. This was at the BTZ plant, during the night shift, probably, late Friday\\nnight. It was at night, they were at the sauna together. And he said, what do \\nyou mean, do you understand what you are saying? The others were silent, \\nprobably, in their hearts they were thinking, I\\'m going to go. But they didn\\'t\\nsay anything to one another. He said that he thought it important to to go, \\nbecause he had heard a lot about what had happened in Kafan, that they had \\nkilled their Azerbaijani sisters, their mothers, burned villages, and all of \\nthat. That guy was also born in Kafan. That is certain. And Marina says that \\nthe Secretary of the Party organization is from Armenia, too.                                                             from\\n\\nI\\'ve participated in the investigation a couple of times. I\\'m satisfied with\\nthem thus far. They summoned us and asked about what happened, and every word \\nI said was recorded. I met some guy there . . . By the way, he was an \\nArmenian. I said that he was in our apartment, but what he did, I don\\'t know. \\nHis last name was Grigorian, Eduard Grigorian. He s from Sumgait, from \\nMicrodistrict 1. He was sentenced I think, to five years, not his first time. \\nHis mother is Russian. I met with him at the KGB in Baku, at the Azerbaijani \\nKGB. They took us there and showed me photographs. There were so many \\nphotographs, I think they even photographed those people who were caught at \\ncurfew, and I\\'ve got them all confused. I say, the face was about like this, \\nthe guy in the white coat with the red clasps. But he could take that coat off\\nand burn it somewhere, and it would be like looking for a needle in a \\nhaystack. Well. This guy, Grigorian, I said, he was in our apartment, but he \\nis so light-complected that he looks like a Lezgin. I don\\'t know what he did, \\nI can\\'t remember. Maybe he beat me or raped me. But he was in our apartment. \\nAt the KGB he started asking me, pleading with me, there\\'s no need for this, \\nall this stuff, look me in the eyes, you\\'re like a sister to me. I took a look\\nat him and thought, \"My God, Heaven forbid that I should have a brother like \\nyou.\" But they were satisfied with my responses, because I said everything \\nwithout great certainty. I was there with Mamma. Then Lyuda came in, but when \\nshe came in she got sick immediately. She wanted to kill him, she crawled over\\nthe table at him. She recognized him. When she came to, Lyuda was lying on the\\nbalcony, the mob threw her there and all of them ran into the bedroom. We had \\nall kinds of boxes with dishes in them, the dowries for all three sisters. \\nThey stole everything in the apartment, leaving only small things. At that \\nmoment Lyuda came to and started remembering everything. Well, seeing the \\nfaces, hearing the voices . . . Two people were saying they could burn the \\napartment. Another says, why burn the apartment when I\\'ve got three kids and \\nno place to live. So this guy was in temporary housing, he didn\\'t have \\nanywhere to live, he was from Sumgait. They were sure that they would get the \\napartment. Besides, the neighbors were Azerbaijani. Why should they burn the \\napartment, they might burn Azerbaijanis. That\\'s what they said. How did they \\nknow there were Azerbaijanis there, if they just picked a place, thinking that\\nArmenians lived there? We have a list of the residents for our part of the \\nbuilding, our name is in there, but how could they know that Azerbaijanis \\nlived on the other side of the wall from us? So they didn\\'t set fire to our \\napartment.\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I was in such bad shape that if all of it had come to a halt \\nwhen I was outside, if someone had asked me what was happening, I would\\nhave said that a civil war was going on. Well, maybe not civil . . . but\\nprobably civil, because when they were beating me I opened my eyes and saw\\nthat all the neighbors were standing on their balconies and watching, like at\\na free horror film. So a civil war was going on, and only the Armenians were\\nbeing fought. If it were a world war or something like that, they would have\\nbeen fighting everyone. But they only fought us. Then I met some women from \\nour building, some Azerbaijanis. They are crying, they tell me, \"Karina, we \\nsaw all of it, how could it happen?\" They\\'re asking me! Well I just don\\'t know\\nwhat to call it if a normal girl can stand there and watch what happened to \\nme. I think that if it were the other way around either I wouldn\\'t have been \\nable to take it, or I would have tried to avert it, like that one Azerbaijani \\nwoman did in front of our building. A woman lives there, an awful, dissipated \\nwoman, if you can call her a woman, the dissipated life she leads. Two \\nArmenian families live there, in her part of the building. She came out on the\\nbalcony and saw what was happening to me and started to scream and curse. She \\ncame down to the entryway and said, \"You\\'ll come in this entryway over my dead\\nbody.\" So not one of them took it in his head to go in that entryway. Some \\nfolks were saying that those people were so out of control that they didn\\'t \\neven know what they were doing. I don\\'t think that\\'s true. They knew very well\\nwhat they were doing if they didn\\'t even lift a hand against that woman. They \\ncouldn\\'t have cared less about her, but the fact that she was an Azerbaijani \\nstopped them.\\n\\nThey were just beasts, they had smoked so much. When they came to our place \\nthey were all chewing something. I noticed: Everyone who came into the \\napartment was chewing something. I think, my God, maybe I just think that? \\nMaybe I\\'m losing my mind? But no, they\\'re all chewing something. Maybe it is \\nsome kind of drug, it must be, because . . . At first glance they all seemed \\nto be such normal people, young, clean-shaven, looking exactly as if they had \\ncome to some sort of celebration. But they were shouting something. They\\ndidn\\'t talk, they shouted, as though there were deaf people there. They \\nscreamed and screamed: \"Yeah, killing, killing, we\\'re killing the Armenians!\" \\nOnly they didn\\'t shout \"kill,\" they shouted \"gurun ermianlary.\" Gurun \\nliterally means \"kill,\" or \"destroy.\"\\n\\nThat\\'s how it was! I\\'ll continue. We hid in a captain\\'s apartment, he\\'s an\\nAzerbaijani, his wife is a Tatar. We were sitting in their apartment, their \\nkids were out in the yard. Their kids knew a whole lot. This was in our part \\nof the building, on the third floor. When Mamma came to and couldn\\'t find\\nLyuda she took Papa\\'s hand, this was while the looters were stealing things,\\nbut they didn\\'t pay attention because they were stealing things. Apparently\\nthey had already ceased killing and switched to stealing. Mamma found the\\ncourage to . . .\\n\\nA boy said to my mother \"Where\\'s the gold?\" Mamma said he must have been 12 \\nto 14 years old. He even looked Russian, he was so fair-skinned. But the \\nAzerbaijanis from Armenia are fair-skinned. I noticed they were all on the \\nfair side. He shouted, they were all smashing things, and he asks Mamma where \\nthe gold is. We kept our gold in the wardrobe with our important papers. In a \\nlittle black bag, we kept everything in there. Mamma doesn\\'t really like to \\nwear gold. She probably never even wore those things from the time they were \\nbought for her. They took everything that was lying on the cheval glass. Mamma\\nthinks that the gold saved us. Because they threw themselves at the gold, and \\nMamma grabbed Papa, who was trying to breathe. They had closed his mouth, \\nbound his hands, and put a pillow and a chair on his face . . . They had \\nshoved something into his mouth so he would suffocate. Mamma grabbed him and \\ntore all that stuff off . . . He had something in his mouth, he was having \\ntrouble breathing, his nose was filled with blood. Mamma grabbed him and \\nstarted running from the fifth down to the first floor because no one wanted \\nto open their doors to them. Mamma said that by accident, completely by \\naccident that person opened his door, he was sleeping, and said, half-awake, \\n\"What\\'s happened?\" He sees that they are bloody. Mamma said, \"At least go and \\nfind out what\\'s happening to my daughters, even if they\\'ve burned them or \\nmurdered them, at least bring the corpses.\" He went looking for us. At that \\nmoment Lyuda was under the bed. She says that after they left it seemed that \\nsomeone was calling her name. When he quietly called her she couldn\\'t get out \\nfrom under the bed. She wanted to get out and was calling softly. She thought \\nshe was shouting, but in fact she was either silent or was only talking to \\nherself, it just seemed to her that she was shouting. When she got out from \\nunder the bed everyone was gone. And again . . . She thought that she had lost\\nher mind. I\\'ll never leave here, never! To hell with it! It just seems that \\nway to me, I\\'ll come to eventually. But then, when everything had settled \\ndown, stopped, that mall brought Lyuda down, and Igor carried me in from\\noutside. Or first I was brought in, then Lyuda, I don\\'t remember what order it\\nhappened in.\\n\\nAnd Mamma said, \"Listen, they\\'re all running around down there, shouting \\nsomething or other, and running toward the other building.\" It had more or \\nless calmed down where we were. Who\\'s dead, who\\'s alive, we don\\'t know. I \\ntried to call my girlfriend. I had basically come to. Mamma says, \"Listen;\\nlet\\'s go upstairs, at least get a mattress or something. We don\\'t know how \\nlong we\\'ll be here. Maybe they didn\\'t burn everything.\" I don\\'t get it, all\\nwomen have that feeling, they want to get something from their homes, maybe \\nnot everything was taken? I tell Mamma, \"Mamma, what do you need any of that \\nfor? To hell with it! We\\'re alive, forget the rest of it, all of it!\" She\\nsays, \"No, let\\'s go get at least something. Maybe we\\'ll leave here, spend the \\nnight at someone else\\'s.\" Mamma went upstairs, and their little boy, their son\\nAlik, was standing on the lookout. lIe was standing there to see if they were \\ncoming. They only managed to run up there and grab something one time. He \\nshouts, \"Come back, they\\'re coming!\" They didn\\'t have enough time to get a \\nlot, mattresses from one apartment, a blanket from another . . . Mamma got my \\nknitting . . . Someone managed to grab our old things, the ones we never wore,\\nout of the hall . . . Someone took Father\\'s old coveralls. The neighbor, his \\nwife, Mamma and Papa . . . Marina went with them. I was in no condition to \\nleave. Neither was Lyuda. We just sat. They ran out and we closed the door and\\njust then we hear that the mob is on its way toward our place upstairs, \\nthey\\'re dragging something again. They were going toward the other building, \\nmaybe over by the school, or . . . There was an unfinished building over\\nthere, people said they were going toward the basement or the unfinished \\nbuilding, they could gradually carry everything over there. Then things more \\nor less calmed down. I tried to call my boss.\\n\\nLater there was more noise. We were on the third floor, in a one-bedroom\\napartment, and a woman lives in the one-bedroom place on the second floor,\\nAsya Dallakian. She\\'s an old woman, retired. She wasn\\'t at home, at that\\ntime she was usually in the country, she has a married daughter there, and\\nher grandson is in the army. She is only very rarely in town; she gets her\\nretirement money and the apartment is essentially vacant. They started\\npounding on her door and broke it down. She had two or three beds in there, \\nsomething like that, she\\'s a 60-to 70-year-old woman who really does not even \\nlive there. Probably she had some pots, a couple of metal bed frames and \\nmattresses, and a television. When her grandson came she bought a television. \\nThey started wrecking everything. I started getting sick again. I think, \"My \\nGod, what is going on around here? When will this end?\" We turned off the \\nlights and sat. As it turns out the people who weren\\'t afraid, the ones who \\nknew what was going on, knew not to turn off the lights. We didn\\'t know, but \\nthey didn\\'t come to where we were all the same. They all knew very well that \\nhe was a captain. He went out and closed the door, and we sat in his \\napartment. His last name was Kasumov. He\\'s an exserviceman, retired, works up \\nat the fire station at some plant or other. He went out and stood at his door.\\nThey tell him, \"Comrade Captain, don\\'t worry, we won\\'t harm you, you\\'re one of\\nus.\" He went upstairs, and they say, \"Aren\\'t you taking anything from this \\napartment?\" He says, \"I don\\'t need anything.\" And the women who were standing \\nin the yard . . . we have a basement, full of water . . . the women who were \\nstanding in the yard saw. Those guys, they left everything they stole on the \\nfirst floor and ran upstairs again. The women threw everything they had time \\nto into the basement, to save our property. Some things were left: dirty \\npillows, two or three other things and a rug. A guy came downstairs, really \\nmad, and he says, \"Where\\'s the rug? I just put it right here!\" They tell him, \\n\"Some guy came and took it and went off toward the school.\" He ran off in that\\ndirection.\\n\\nOh! I forgot the most important point. When Igor picked me up in his arms, \\nthere were women standing there who saw everything that was going on. They \\njust didn\\'t tell me about it for a long time. The wife of that military man, \\nshe didn\\'t want to kill my spirit, I was already dead enough. Later she told \\nme, that after they murdered Uncle Shurik in the third entryway one of them, \\nthe ringleader, apparently a young man, said, \"Where\\'s the girl who was here?\"\\nAnd he became furious. The woman tells him, \"She came to . . . \" She didn\\'t\\nknow what to say: Think something up? Someone carried her off? Then they would\\ncomb the whole house and find me and our whole family. So the woman says, \"She\\ncame to and went to the basement.\" Now, our basement is full of water. So the \\nwhole mob dashes off to the basement to look for me or my corpse. They took \\nflashlights; they were up to their waists in water, water which had been \\nstanding there for years, and soot, and fuel oil. They climbed down in there \\nto get me. Then one of them said, \"There\\'s so much water down there, she \\nprobably walked and walked and then passed out and died. She met her death in \\nthe basement. That\\'s it, we can leave, no problem!\" I didn\\'t know that, and \\nwhen I was told, I felt worse. Two times worse. A lot worse! So they didn\\'t \\njust want to pound me flat, something more awful was awaiting me . . .\\n\\nAfter that we of course didn\\'t want to live in Sumgait any longer. We really \\ndidn\\'t want to go back to our apartment. When we moved, I went up there and \\nstarted to quiver and shake all over, because I started remembering it all. \\nAlthough the neighbors all sobbed, it was all . . . so cheap . . . The people \\nwho sat in their apartments and didn\\'t help us at a time like that. I think \\nthat they could have helped! I don\\'t think that they were obligated to, but \\nthey could have helped us! Because that one woman was able to stop that whole \\nbrutal crowd by herself. That means they could have, too. It would have been\\nenough foe one man or women to say, What do you think you\\'re doing?\" That\\'s \\nall! That would have done it. There were 60 apartments in our building. Not \\none person said it! When I was lying on the ground and all those people were \\nstanding on their balconies I didn\\'t hear anyone\\'s voice, no one said what are\\nyou doing, leave her alone . . . Mamma even told one of the neighbor women \\nthat if it had been an Azerbaijani woman in my place they would have dropped a\\nbomb if it would have killed even one Armenian. They would have stood up for \\none of their own. True, they say that our neighbor from the fourth entryway, \\nan old/ sick woman tried to stop the pogrom. The Azerbaijanis have a custom: \\nif a woman takes her scarf and throws it on the ground, the men are supposed \\nto stop immediately. The old woman from the fourth entryway did that, but they\\nstomped her scarf into the ground, pushed her off to the side, and said, \"If\\nyou want to go on living, you\\'ll disappear into your apartment.\" So she left.\\nThat trick didn\\'t work on them.\\n\\nEven the neighbors who helped us move told me, OK, fine, calm down, forget \\nthat it happened. I said I\\'d only forget it if I told them right then that it\\nhad happened to their daughter--and if that didn\\'t have any effect on them, \\nthen I would forget everything, too. Imagine that it happened to your sister. \\nAnd no one did anything.

I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd\\ntake Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1\\nnetminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than\\nthat after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records\\nare similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as\\nthe most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.\\n\\nYou say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well\\nbe, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in\\nthose games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,\\nthe defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.\\n\\n> The same\\n> for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a\\n> great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If\\n> you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.\\n\\nBut I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play\\nfor the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just\\nmy opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that\\nabout Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm\\nbatting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.\\n\\nAs for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the\\noffensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the\\nsave.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't\\nget the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's\\nwhat the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the\\nshooter to beat him.\\n\\n> But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie\\n> stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel\\n> doesn't have a game like that in him.\\n\\nI seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on\\nopening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending\\nchamps.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was\\nsenational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a\\nMontreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game\\nand just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are\\npart of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and\\nI'm not going to argue about it anymore.

They left and I had an attack. I realized that the dan-\\nger was past, and stopped controlling myself. I relaxed for a moment and the \\nphysical pain immediately made itself felt. My heart and kidneys hurt. I had \\nan awful kidney attack. I rolled back and forth on top of those Christmas\\nornaments, howling and howling. I didn\\'t know where I was or how long this \\nwent on. When we figured out the time, later it turned out that I howled and \\nwas in pain for around an hour. Then all my strength was gone and I burst into\\ntears, I started feeling sorry for myself, and so on and so forth . . .\\n\\nThen someone came into the room. I think I hear someone calling my name. I \\nwant to respond and restrain myself, I think that I\\'m hallucinating. I am \\nsilent, and then it continues: it seems that first a man\\'s voice is calling\\nme, then a woman\\'s. Later I found out that Mamma had sent our neighbor, the\\none whose apartment she was hiding in, Uncle Sabir Kasumov, to our place, \\ntelling him, \"I know that they\\'ve killed Lyuda. Go there and at least bring \\nher corpse to me so they don\\'t violate her corpse.\" He went and returned empty\\nhanded, but Mamma thought he just didn\\'t want to carry the corpse into his \\napartment. She sent him another time, and then sent his wife, and they were \\nwalking through the rooms looking for me, but I didn\\'t answer their calls. \\nThere was no light, they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps.\\n\\nThey started the pogrom in our apartment around five o\\'clock, and at 9:30 I \\nwent down to the Kasumovs\\'. I went down the stairs myself. I walked out of the\\napartment: how long can you wait for your own death, how long can you be \\ncowardly, afraid? Come what will. I walked out and started knocking on the \\ndoors one after the next. No one, not on the fifth floor, not on the fourth, \\nopened the door. On the third floor, on the landing of the stairway, Uncle \\nSabir\\'s son started to shout, \"Aunt Roza, don\\'t cry, Lyuda\\'s alive!\" He \\nknocked on his own door and out came Aunt Tanya, Igor, and after them, Mamma. \\nAunt Tanya, Uncle Sabir\\'s wife, is an Urdmurt. All of us were in their \\napartment. I didn\\'t see Karina, but she was in their home, too, Lying\\ndelirious, she had a fever. Marina was there too, and my father and mother.\\nAll of my family had gathered there.\\n   \\nAt the door I lost consciousness. Igor and Aunt Tanya carried me into the\\napartment.\\n\\nLater I found out what they had done to our Karina. Mamma said, \"Lyuda, \\nKarina\\'s in really serious condition, she\\'s probably dying. If she recognizes \\nyou, don\\'t cry, don\\'t tell her that her face looks so awful.\" It was as though\\nher whole face was paralyzed, you know, everything was pushed over to one \\nside, her eye was all swollen, and everything flowed together, her lips, her \\ncheeks . . . It was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole\\nmicrodistrict, that\\'s how disfigured her face was. I said, \"Fine.\" Mamma was \\nafraid to go into the room, because she went in and hugged Karina and started \\nto cry. I went in. As soon as I saw her my legs gave way. I fell down near the\\nbed, hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying. She opened the eye \\nthat was intact, looked at me, and said, \"Who is it?\" But I could barely talk, \\nmy whole face was so badly beaten. I didn\\'t say, but rather muttered something\\ntender, something incomprehensible, but tender, \"My Karochka, my Karina, my \\nlittle golden one . . . \" She understood me.\\n\\nThen Igor brought me some water, I drank it down and moistened Karina\\'s lips. \\nShe started to groan. She was saying something to me, but I couldn\\'t \\nunderstand it. Then I made out, \"It hurts, I hurt all over.\" Her hair was \\nglued down with blood. I stroked her forehead, her head, she had grit on her \\nforehead, and on her lips . . . She was groaning again, and I don\\'t know how \\nto help her. She calls me over with her hand, come closer. I go to her. She\\'s\\nsaying something to me, but I can\\'t understand her. Igor brings her a pencil \\nand paper and says, \"Write it down.\" She shakes her head as if to say, no, I \\ncan\\'t write. I can\\'t understand what she\\'s saying. She wanted to tell me \\nsomething, but she couldn\\'t. I say, \"Karina, just lie there a little while,\\nthen maybe you\\'ll feel better and you can tell me then.\" And then she says,\\n\"Maybe it\\'ll be too late.\" And I completely . . . just broke down, I couldn\\'t\\ncontrol myself.\\n\\nThen I moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye. I dipped\\na handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips. She \\nsays, \"Lyuda, we\\'re not saved yet, we have to go somewhere else. Out of this \\ndamned house. They want to kill us, I know. They\\'ll find us here, too. We need\\nto call Urshan.\" She repeated this to me for almost a whole hour, Until I \\nunderstood her every word. I ask, \"What\\'s his number?\" Urshan Feyruzovich, \\nthat\\'s the head of the administration where she works. \"We have to call him.\" \\nBut I didn\\'t know his home number. I say, \"Karina, what\\'s his number?\" She \\nsays, \"I can\\'t remember.\" I say, \"Who knows his number? Who can I call?\" She \\nsays, \"I don\\'t know anything, leave me alone.\"\\n\\nI went out of the room. Igor stayed to watch over her and sat there, he was \\ncrying, too. I say, \"Mamma, Karina says that we have to call Urshan. How can \\nwe call him? Who knows his telephone number?\" I tell Marina, \"Think, think, \\nwho can we call to find out?\" She started calling; several people didn\\'t \\nanswer. She called a girlfriend, her girlfriend called another girlfriend and \\nfound out the number and called us back. The boss\\'s wife answered and said he \\nwas at the dacha. My voice keeps cracking, I can\\'t talk normally. She says, \\n\"Lyuda, don\\'t panic, get a hold of yourself, go out to those hooligans and \\ntell them that they just can\\'t do that.\" She still didn\\'t know what was really\\ngoing on. I said, \"It\\'s easy for you to say that, you don\\'t understand what\\'s \\nhappening. They are killing people here. I don\\'t think there is a single \\nArmenian left in the building, they\\'ve cut them all up. I\\'m even surprised \\nthat we managed to save ourselves. \"She says, \"Well, OK, if it\\'s that serious \\n. . . \" And all the same she\\'s thinking that my emotions are all churned up \\nand that I\\'m fearing for my life, that in fact it\\'s not all that bad. \"OK, \\nfine, fine,\" she says, \"if you\\'re afraid, OK, as soon as Urshan comes back \\nI\\'ll send him over.\"\\n\\nWe called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly \\nunder Aunt Tanya\\'s, on the second floor, Asya Dallakian\\'s apartment. She \\nwasn\\'t home, she was staying with her daughter in Karabagh. They destroyed \\neverything there . . . We realized that they still might come back. We kept on\\ntrying to get through to Aunt Tanya--Urshan\\'s wife is named Tanya too and \\nfinally we get through. She says, \"Yes, he\\'s come home, he\\'s leaving for your \\nplace now.\" He came. Of course he didn\\'t know what was happening, either, \\nbecause he brought two of his daughters with him. He came over in his jeep \\nwith his two daughters, like he was going on an outing. He came and saw what \\nshape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened. He has \\ngrown up daughters, they\\'re almost my age.\\n\\nThe three of us carried out Karina, tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf, and\\nwent down to his car. He took Karina and me to the Maternity Home. . . No, \\nfirst they took us to the po]ice precinct. They had stretchers ready. As\\nsoon as we got out of the car they put Karina and me on stretchers and said\\nthat we were in serious condition and that we mustn\\'t move, we might have\\nfractures. From the stretcher I saw about 30 soldiers sitting and lying on the\\nfirst floor, bandaged, on the concrete floor, groaning . . . This was around\\neleven o\\'clock at night. We had left the house somewhere around 1:30. When I \\nsaw those soldiers I realized that a war was going on: soldiers, enemies\\n. . . everything just like a war.\\n\\nThey carried me into some office on the stretcher. The emergency medical\\npeople from Baku were there. The medical attendant there was an older \\nArmenian. Urshan told him what they had done to Karina because she\\'s so proud \\nshe would never have told. And this aging Armenian . . . his name was Uncle \\nArkady, I think, because someone said \"Arkady, get an injection ready,\" he \\nstarted to fill a syringe, and turned around so as to give Karina a shot. But \\nwhen he looked at her face he became ill. And he was an old man, in his \\nsixties, his hair was all grey, and his moustache, too. He hugged Karina and \\nstarted to cry: \"What have they done to you?!\" He was speaking Armenian. \"What\\nhave they done to you?!\" Karina didn\\'t say anything. Mamma came in then, and \\nshe started to cry, too. The man tried to calm her. \"I\\'ll give you a shot.\" \\nMamma tells him, \"I don\\'t need any shot. Where is the government? Just what \\nare they doing? Look what they\\'ve done to my children! They\\'re killing people,\\nand you\\'re just sitting here!\" Some teacups were standing on the table in \\nthere. \"You\\'re sitting here drinking tea! Look what they\\'ve done to my \\ndaughters! Look what they\\'ve turned them into!\" They gave her something to \\ndrink, some heart medicine, I think. They gave Karina an injection and the\\ndoctor said that she had to be taken to the Maternity Home immediately. Papa \\nand Urshan, I think, even though Papa was in bad shape, helped carry Karina \\nout. When they put her on the stretcher, none of the medics got near her. I \\ndon\\'t know, maybe there weren\\'t any orderlies. Then they came to me: \"What\\'s \\nthe matter with you?\" Their tone was so official that I wrapped myself tighter\\nin the half-length coat. I had a blanket on, too, an orange one, Aunt Tanya\\'s.\\nI said, \"I\\'m fine.\" Uncle Arkady came over and was soothing me, and then told \\nthe doctor, \"You leave, let a woman examine her.\" A woman came, an \\nAzerbaijani, I believe, and said, \"What\\'s wrong with you?\" I was wearing my \\nsister Lyuda\\'s nightshirt, the sister who at this time was in Yerevan. When \\nshe was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would \\nbe easier to breast feed the baby. I tore the night shirt some more and showed\\nher. I took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her. There was a huge \\nwound, about the size of a hand, on my back, from the Indian vase. She said \\nsomething to them and they gave me two shots. She said that it should be \\ndressed with something, but that they\\'d do that in the hospital.\\n\\nThey put me on a stretcher, too. They started looking for people to carry me. \\nI raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up, and this woman, I don\\'t \\nknow if she was a doctor or a nurse, said, \"Lie still, you mustn\\'t move.\" When\\nI was lying back down I saw two policemen leading a man. His profile seemed \\nvery familiar to me. I shouted, \"Stop!\" One of the policemen turned and says, \\n\"What do you want?\" I say, \"Bring him to me, I want to look at him.\" They \\nbrought him over and I said, \"That person was just in our apartment and he \\njust raped me and my sister. I recognize him, note it down.\" They said, \\n\"Fine,\" but didn\\'t write it down and led him on. I don\\'t know where they were \\ntaking him.\\n\\nThen they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were \\nsitting. They went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car \\nup closer. One of the soldiers started talking to me, \"Sister . . . \" I don\\'t \\nremember the conversation exactly, but he asked me were we lived and what they\\ndid to us. I asked him, \"Where are you from?\" He said that he was from Ufa. \\nApparently they were the first that were brought in. The Ufa police. Later I \\nlearned that they suffered most of all. He says, \"OK, you\\'re Armenians, they \\ndidn\\'t get along with you, but I\\'m a Russian,\" he says, \"what are they trying \\nto kill me for?\" Oh, I remembered something else. When I went out onto the \\nbalcony with Kuliyev for a hammer and nails I looked out the window and saw \\ntwo Azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten. He was pressed \\nagainst the fence and he covered his head with his arms, they were beating him\\nwith his own club. The way he cried \"Mamma\" made my skin crawl. I don\\'t know \\nwhat they did to him, if he\\'s still alive or not. And something else. Before \\nhe attack on our house we saw sheets, clothes, and some dishes flying from the\\nthird or fourth floor of the neighboring building, but I didn\\'t think it was \\nAzerbaijanis attacking Armenians. I thought that something was on fire or they\\nwere throwing something they didn\\'t need out, or someone was fighting with \\nsomeone. It was only later, when they were burning a passenger car in the \\nyard, when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the Armenians, that\\nI realized that this was serious, that it was anti-Armenian.\\n\\nThey took Karina and me to the Sumgait Maternity Home. Mamma went to them too \\nand said, \"I\\'ve been beaten too, help me.\" But they just ignored her. My \\nfather went to them and said in a guilty voice, as though it was his fault \\nthat he\\'d been beaten, and says, \"My ribs hurt so much, those creeps have \\nprobably broken my ribs. Please look at them.\" The doctor says, \"That\\'s not my\\njob.\" Urshan said, \"Fine, I\\'ll take you to my place and if we need a doctor, \\nI\\'ll find you one. I\\'ll bring one and have him look at you. And he drove them \\nto his apartment.\\n\\nMarina and I stayed there. They examined us. I was more struck by what the \\ndoctor said than by what those Azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us. I \\nwasn\\'t surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us, but I was very\\nsurprised that in a Soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the\\nHippocratic Oath could talk to victims like that. By happy--or unhappy--\\ncoincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our Karina. And she,\\nhaving examined Karina, said, \"No problem, you got off pretty good. Not like \\nthey did in Kafan, when you Armenians were killing and raping our women.\\n\"Karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn\\'t say anything--she\\nwould certainly have had something to say! Then they examined me. The same \\nstory. They put us in a separate ward. No shots, no medicinal powders, no \\ndrugs. Absolutely none! They didn\\'t even give us tea. All the women there soon\\nfound out that in ward such and such were Armenians who had been raped. And\\nthey started coming and peering through the keyhole, the way people look at \\nzoo animals. Karina didn\\'t see this, she was lying there, and I kept her from \\nseeing it.\\n\\nThey put Ira B. in our ward. She had also been raped. True, she didn\\'t have \\nany serious bodily injuries, but when she told me what had happened at their \\nplace, I felt worse for them than I did for us. Because when they raped Ira \\nher daughter was in the room, she was under the bed on which it happened. And\\nIra was holding her daughter\\'s hand, the one who was hiding under the bed.\\nWhen they were beating Ira or taking her earrings off, gold, when she \\ninvoluntarily let go of her daughter\\'s hand, her daughter took her hand again.\\nHer daughter is in the fourth grade, she\\'s 11 years old. I felt really awful \\nwhen I heard that. Ira asked them not to harm her daughter, she said, \"Do what\\nyou want with me, just leave my daughter alone.\" Well, they did what they \\nwanted. They threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way. Now I \\nwould be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night. It \\nwas simply Bartholomew\\'s Night, I say, they did what they would love to do \\nevery day: steal, kill, rape . . .\\n\\nMany are surprised that those animals didn\\'t harm the children. The beasts \\nexplained it like this: this would be repeated in 15 to 20 years, and those \\nchildren would be grown, and then, as they put it, \"we\\'ll come take the \\npleasure out of their lives, those children.\" This was about the girls that\\nwould be young women in 15 years. They were thinking about their tomorrow \\nbecause they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation, just\\nas there was no trial or investigation in 1915, and that those girls could be \\nof some use in 15 years. This I heard from the investigators; one of the \\nvictims testified to it. That\\'s how they described their own natures, that\\nthey would still be bloodthirsty in 15 to 20 years, and in 100 years--they\\nthemselves said that.\\n\\nAnd this, too. Everyone is surprised that they didn\\'t harm our Marina. Many \\npeople say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much. I don\\'t know \\nwhy their eyes were red. Maybe because they hadn\\'t slept the night before, \\nmaybe for some other reason, I don\\'t know. But they hadn\\'t been smoking and \\nthey weren\\'t drunk, I\\'m positive, because someone who has smoked will stop at \\nnothing he has the urge to do. And they spoke in a cultured fashion with \\nMarina: \"Little sister, don\\'t be afraid, we won\\'t harm you, don\\'t look over \\nthere [where I was], you might be frightened. You\\'re a Muslim, a Muslim woman \\nshouldn\\'t see such things.\" So they were really quite sober . . .\\n\\nSo we came out of that story alive. Each every day we have lived since it all \\nhappened bears the mark of that day. It wasn\\'t even a day, of those several \\nhours. Father still can\\'t look us in the eyes. He still feels guilty for what\\nhappened to Karina, Mother, and me. Because of his nerves he\\'s started talk-\\ning to himself, I\\'ve heard him argue with himself several times when he\\nthought no one is listening: \"Listen,\" he\\'ll say, \"what could I do? What could\\nI do alone, how could I protect them?\" I don\\'t know where to find the words,\\nit\\'s not that I\\'m happy, but I am glad that he didn\\'t see it all happen. \\nThat\\'s the only thing they spared us . . . or maybe it happened by chance. Of \\ncourse he knows it all, but there\\'s no way you could imagine every last detail\\nof what happened. And there were so many conversations: Karina and I spoke\\ntogether in private, and we talked with Mamma, too. But Father was never\\npresent at those conversations. We spare him that, if you can say that. And\\nwhen the investigator comes to the house, we don\\'t speak with Father present.\\n\\nOn February 29, the next clay, Karina and I were discharged from the hospital.\\nFirst they released me, but since martial law had been declared in the city, \\nthe soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier. \\nThere were many people there, Armenian victims. I met the Tovmasian family \\nthere. From them I learned that Rafik and their Uncle Grant had died. They \\nwere sure that both had died. They were talking to me and Raya, Rafik\\'s wife \\nand Grant\\'s daughter, and her mother, were both crying.\\n\\nThen they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard.\\nThere\\'s a little one-room house outside there, a recreation and reading area.\\nThey took us in there. The women were afraid to go because they thought\\nthat they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become\\nso dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide.\\nThe women were shouting. They explained to them: \"We want to hide you\\nbetter because it\\'s possible there will be an attack on the police precinct.\"\\n\\nWe went into the little house. There were no chairs or tables in there. We\\nhad children with us and they were hungry; we even had infants who needed to \\nhave their diapers changed. No one had anything with them. It was just awful. \\nThey kept us there for 24 hours. From the window of the one room house you \\ncould see that there were Azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the \\npolice precinct, as though they were spying on us. The police precinct is \\nsurrounded by a wall, like a fence, and it\\'s electrified, but if they were \\nstanding on the wall, it means the electricity was shut off. This brought \\ngreat psychological pressure to bear on us, particularly on those who hadn\\'t \\njust walked out of their apartments, but who hadn\\'t slept for 24 hours, or 48,\\nor those who had suffered physically and spiritually, the ones who had lost \\nfamily members. For us it was another ordeal. We were especially frightened \\nwhen all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared. We couldn\\'t see a single\\nperson, not in the courtyard and not in the windows. We thought that they must\\nhave already been hiding under the building, that they must have some secret \\nroom down there. People were panicking: they started throwing themselves at\\none another . . . That\\'s the way it is on a sinking ship. We heard those \\npeople, mainly young people, whistling and whopping on the walls. We felt that\\nthe end was approaching. I was completely terrified: I had left Karina in the \\nhospital and didn\\'t know where my parents were. I was sort of calm about my \\nparents, I was thinking only about Karina, if, Heaven forbid, they should \\nattack the hospital, they would immediately tell them that there was an \\nArmenian in there, and something terrible would happen to Karina again, and \\nshe wouldn\\'t be able to take it.\\n\\nThen soldiers with dogs appeared. When they saw the dogs some of the people \\nclimbed down off the fence. Then they brought in about another 30 soldiers.\\nThey all had machine guns in readiness, their fingers on the triggers. We \\ncalmed down a little. They brought us chairs and brought the children some \\nlittle cots and showed us where we could wash our hands, and took the children\\nto the toilet. But we all sat there hungry, but to be honest, it would never \\nhave occurred to any of us that we hadn\\'t eaten for two days and that people \\ndo eat.\\n\\nThen, closer to nightfall, they brought a group of detained criminals. They \\nwere being watched by soldiers with guard dogs. One of the men came back from \\nthe courtyard and told us about it. Raya Tovmasian . . . it was like a \\ndifferent woman had been substituted. Earlier she had been crying, wailing, \\nand calling out: \"Oh, Rafik!,\" but when she heard about this such a rage came \\nover her! She jumped up, she had a coat on, and she started to roll up her \\nsleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone. And suddenly there were \\nsoldiers, and dogs, and lots of people. She ran over to them. The bandits were\\nstanding there with their hands above their heads facing the wall. She went up\\nto one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash \\nhim! Then, on to a second, and a third. Everyone was rooted to the spot. Not \\none of the soldiers moved, no one went up to help or made her stop her from \\ndoing it. And the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands, \\nmuttering something. She came back and sat down, and something akin to a smile\\nappeared on her face. She became so quiet: no tears, no cries. Then that round\\nwas over and she went back to beat them again. She was walking and cursing \\nterribly: take that, and that, they killed my husband, the bastards, the \\ncreeps, and so on. Then she came back again and sat down. She probably did \\nthis the whole night through, well, it wasn\\'t really night, no one slept. She \\nwent five or six times and beat them and returned. And she told the women, \\n\"What are you sitting there for? They killed your husbands and children, they \\nraped, and you\\'re just sitting there. You\\'re sitting and talking as though \\nnothing had happened. Aren\\'t you Armenians?\" She appealed to everyone, but no \\none got up. I was just numb, I didn\\'t have the strength to beat anyone, I \\ncould barely hold myself up, all the more so since I had been standing for so \\nmany hours--I was released at eleven o\\'clock in the morning and it was already\\nafter ten at night because there weren\\'t enough chairs, really it was the \\nelderly and women with children who sat. I was on my feet the whole time. \\nThere was nothing to breathe, the door was closed, and the men were smoking. \\nThe situation was deplorable.\\n\\nAt eleven o\\'clock at night policemen came for us, local policemen, \\nAzerbaijanis. They said, \"Get up. They\\'ve brought mattresses, you can wash up\\nand put the children to bed.\" Now the women didn\\'t want to leave this place, \\neither. The place had become like home, it was safe, there were soldiers with \\ndogs. If anyone went outside, the soldiers would say, \"Oh, it\\'s our little \\nfamily,\" and things like that. The soldiers felt this love, and probably, for \\nthe first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders. Everyone\\nspoke from the heart, cried, and hugged them and they, with their loaded\\nmachine guns in their hands, said, \"Grandmother, you mustn\\'t approach me,\\nI\\'m on guard.\" Our people would say, \"Oh, that\\'s all right.\" They hugged\\nthem, one woman even kissed one of the machine guns. This was all terribly\\nmoving for me. And the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs.\\n\\nThey took us up to the second floor and said, \"You can undress and sleep in \\nhere. Don\\'t be afraid, the precinct is on guard, and it\\'s quiet in the city.\"\\nThis was the 29th, when the killing was going on in block 41A and in other\\nplaces. Then we were told that all the Armenians were being gathered at the\\nSK club and at the City Party Committee. They took us there. On the way I \\nasked them to stop at the Maternity Home: I wanted to take Karina with me.\\nI didn\\'t know what was happening there. They told me, \"Don\\'t worry, the\\nMaternity Home is full of soldiers, more than mothers-to-be. So you can rest\\nassured. I say, \"Well, I won\\'t rest assured regardless, because the staff in\\nthere is capable of anything.\"\\n\\nWhen I arrived at the City Party Committee it turned out that Karina had\\nalready been brought there. They had seen fit to release her from the hospi-\\ntal, deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care. Once\\nwe were in the City Party Committee we gave free reign to our tears. We met \\nacquaintances, but everyone was somehow divided into two groups, those who \\nhadn\\'t been injured, who were clothed, who had brought a pot of food with \\nthem, and so on, and those, like me, like Raya, who were wearing whatever had \\ncome their way. There were even people who were all made up, dolled up like \\nthey had come from a wedding. There were people without shoes, naked people, \\nhungry people, those who were crying, and those who had lost someone. And of \\ncourse the stories and the talk were flying: \"Oh, I heard that they killed \\nhim!\" \"What do you mean they killed him!\" \"He stayed at work!\" \"Do you know \\nwhat\\'s happening at this and such a plant? Talk like that.\\n\\nAnd then I met Aleksandr Mikhailovich Gukasian, the teacher. I know him very \\nwell and respect him highly. I\\'ve known him for a long time. They had a small \\nroom, well really it was more like a study-room. We spent a whole night \\ntalking in that study once. On March 1 we heard that Bagirov [First Secretary \\nof the Communist Party of Azerbaijan SSR] had arrived. Everyone ran to see \\nBagirov, what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed \\nfrom outside. He arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask \\nhim things. Everyone was in a tremendous rage. But he was protected by \\nsoldiers, and he went up to the second floor and didn\\'t deign to speak with \\nthe people. Apparently he had more important things to do.\\n\\nSeveral hours passed. Gukasian called me and says, \"Lyudochka, find another \\ntwo or three. We\\'re going to make up lists, they asked for them upstairs, \\nlists of the dead, those whose whereabouts are unknown, and lists of people \\nwho had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned.\" I \\nhad about 50 people in my list when they called me and said, \"Lyuda, your \\nMamma has arrived, she\\'s looking for you, she doesn\\'t believe that you are \\nalive and well and that you\\'re here.\" I gave the lists to someone and asked \\nthem to continue what I was doing and went off.\\n\\nThe list was imprecise, of course. It included Grant Adamian, Raya Tovmasian\\'s\\nfather, who was alive, but at the time they thought him dead. There was Engels\\nGrigorian\\'s father and aunt, Cherkez and Maria. The list also included the \\nname of my girlfriend and neighbor, Zhanna Agabekian. One of the guys said \\nthat he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front\\nof the Kosmos movie theater. We put her on the list too, and cried, but later \\nit turned out that that was just a rumor, that in fact an hour earlier she had\\nsomehow left Sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for \\nKrasnovodsk, where, thank God, she was alive and well. I should also say that \\nin addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored \\nmissing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead.                                                                 3\\n\\nAll the lists were taken to Bagirov. I don\\'t remember how many dead were \\ncontained in the list, but it\\'s a fact that when Gukasian came in a couple \\nof minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate. I asked, \"What\\'s \\ngoing on?\" He said, \"Lyuda, can you imagine what animals, what scoundrels\\nthey are! They say that they lost the list of the dead. Piotr Demichev\\n[Member of the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party\\nof the USSR] has just arrived, and we were supposed to submit the list to\\nhim, so that he\\'d see the scope of the slaughter, of the tragedy, whether it\\nwas one or fifty.\" They told him that the list had disappeared and they\\nshould ask everyone who hadn\\'t left for the Khimik boarding house all over\\nagain. There were 26 people on our second list. I think that the number 26\\nwas the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio, because\\nthat\\'s the list that Demichev got. I remember exactly that there were 26 \\npeople on the list, I had even told Aleksandr Mikhailovich that that was only \\na half of those that were on the first list. He said, \"Lyuda, please, try to\\nremember at least one more.\" But I couldn\\'t remember anyone else. But there\\nwere more than 30 dead. Of that I am certain. The government and the Procuracy\\ndon\\'t count the people who died of fright, like sick people and old people \\nwhose lives are threatened by any shock. They weren\\'t registered as victims of\\nthe Sumgait tragedy. And then there may be people we didn\\'t know. So many \\npeople left Sumgait between March 1 and 8! Most of them left for smaller towns\\nin Russia, and especially to the Northern Caucasus, to Stavropol, and the \\nKrasnodarsk Territory. We don\\'t have any information on them. I know that \\nthere are people who set out for parts around Moscow. In the periodical \\nKrestyanka [Woman Farmer] there was a call for people who know how to milk \\ncows, and for mechanics, and drivers, and I know a whole group of people went \\nto help out. Also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering\\nthe city, who were burned in their cars. No one knows about them, except the \\nAzerbaijanis, who are hardly likely to say anything about it. And there\\'s\\nmore. A great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list \\ndrawn up at the Procuracy. I know of three instances for sure, and I of course\\ndon\\'t know them all. I\\'m thinking of three women whose parents chose not to \\npublicize what had happened, that is, they didn\\'t take the matter to court, \\nthey simply left. But in so doing they didn\\'t cease being victims. One of them\\nis the first cousin of my classmate Kocharian. She lived in Microdistrict No. \\n8, on the fifth floor. I can\\'t tell you the building number and I don\\'t know \\nher name. Then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives, she lived in \\nMicrodistrict 1 near the gift shop. I don\\'t know her name, she lives on the \\nsame landing as the Sumgait procurator. They beat her father, he was holding \\nthe door while his daughter hid, but he couldn\\'t hold the door forever, and \\nwhen she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors\\' they seized her by her \\nbraid. Like the Azerbaijanis were saying, it was a very cultured mob, because \\nthey didn\\'t kill anyone, they only raped them and left. And the third one \\n. . . I don\\'t remember who the third one was anymore.\\n\\nThey transferred us on March 1. Karina still wasn\\'t herself. Yes, we lived for\\ndays in the SK, in the cultural facility, and at the Khimik. They lived there \\nand I lived at the City Party Committee because I couldn\\'t stay with Karina; \\nit was too difficult for me, but I was at peace: she had survived. I could \\nalready walk, but really it was honest words that held me up. Thanks to the \\nsocial work I did there, I managed to persevere. Aleksandr Mikhailovich said, \\n\"If it weren\\'t for the work I would go insane.\" He and I put ourselves in gear\\nand took everything upon ourselves: someone had an infant and needed diapers \\nand free food, and we went to get them. The first days we bought everything, \\nalthough we should have received it for free. They were supposed to have been \\ndispensed free of charge, and they sold it to us. Then, when we found out it \\nwas free, we went to Krayev. At the time, fortunately, you could still drop by\\nto see him like a neighbor, all the more so since everything was still clearly\\nvisible on our faces. Krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue.\\n\\nOn March 2 they sent two investigators to see us: Andrei Shirokov and Vladimir\\nFedorovich Bibishev. The way it worked out, in our family they had considered \\nonly Karina and me victims, maybe because she and I wound up in the hospital.\\nMother and Father are considered witnesses, but not victims.\\n\\nShirokov was involved with Karina\\'s case, and Bibishev, with mine. After I \\ntold him everything, he and I planned to sit down with the identikit and\\nrecord everyone I could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind. \\nWe didn\\'t work with the identikit until the very last day because the\\nconditions weren\\'t there. The investigative group worked slowly and did poor \\nquality work solely because the situation wasn\\'t conducive to working: there \\nweren\\'t enough automobiles, especially during the time when there was a \\ncurfew, and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts, and no still or \\nvideo cameras. I think that this was done on purpose. We\\'re not so poor that \\nwe can\\'t supply our investigators with all that stuff. It was done especially \\nto draw out the investigation, all the more so since the local authorities saw\\nthat the Armenians were leaving at the speed of light, never to return to \\nSumgait. And the Armenians had a lot to say I came to an agreement with \\nBibishev, I told him myself, \"Don\\'t you worry, if it takes us a month or two \\nmonths, I\\'ll be here. I\\'m not afraid, I looked death in the eyes five times in\\nthose two days, I\\'ll help you conduct the investigation.\"\\n\\nHe and I worked together a great deal, and I used this to shelter Karina, I\\ngave them so much to do that for a while they didn\\'t have the time to get to\\nher, so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her-\\nself. She was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x-\\nrays. She couldn\\'t eat or drink for nine days, she was nauseous. I didn\\'t eat\\nand drank virtually nothing for five days. Then, on the fifth day, when we\\nwere in Baku already, the investigator told me, \"How long can you go on like \\nthis? Well fine, so you don\\'t want to eat, you don\\'t love yourself, you\\'re\\nnot taking care of yourself, but you gave your word that you would see this\\ninvestigation through. We need you.\" Then I started eating, because in fact I\\nwas exhausted. It wasn\\'t enough that I kept seeing those faces in our apart-\\nment in my mind, every day I went to the investigative solitary confinement\\ncells and prisons. I don\\'t know . . . we were just everywhere! Probably in\\nevery prison in the city of Baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of\\nSumgait. At that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary \\nconfinement.\\n\\nThus far I have identified 31 of the people who were in our apartment. Mamma \\nidentified three, and Karina, two. The total is 36. Marina didn\\'t identify \\nanyone, she remembers the faces of two or three, But they weren\\'t among the \\nphotographs of those detained. I told of the neighbor I recognized. The one \\nwho went after the axe. He still hasn\\'t been detained, he\\'s still on the \\nloose. He\\'s gone, and it\\'s not clear if he will be found or not. I don\\'t know \\nhis first or last name. I know which building he lived in and I know his \\nsisters\\' faces. But he\\'s not in the city. The investigators informed me that \\neven if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will \\ncontinue looking for him.\\n\\nThe 31 people I identified are largely blue-collar workers from various \\nplants, without education, and of the very lowest level in every respect.\\nMostly their ages range from 20 to 30 years; there was one who was 48. Only\\none of them was a student. He was attending the Azerbaijan Petroleum and\\nChemical Institute in Sumgait, his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga-\\ntor. Once, thinking that I was an employee and not a victim, she said in front\\nof me \"I\\'ll set you up a restaurant worth 500 rubles and give you 600 in cash\\nsimply for keeping him out of Armenia,\" that is, to keep him from landing in\\na prison on Armenian soil. They\\'re all terribly afraid of that, because if the\\ninvestigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn\\'t confess even\\nthough we identified him, they tell him--in order to apply psychological\\npressure--they say, \"Fine, don\\'t confess, just keep silent. When you\\'re in an\\nArmenian prison, when they find out who you are, they\\'ll take care of you\\nin short order.\" That somehow gets to them. Many give in and start to talk.\\n\\nThe investigators and I were in our apartment and videotaped the entire\\npogrom of our apartment, as an investigative experiment. It was only then\\nthat I saw the way they had left our apartment. Even without knowing who was \\nin our apartment, you could guess. They stole, for example, all the money and \\nall the valuables, but didn\\'t take a single book. They tore them up, burned \\nthem, poured water on them, and hacked them with axes. Only the Materials\\nfrom the 27th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and James \\nFenimore Cooper\\'s Last of the Mohigans. Oh yes, lunch was ready, we were \\nboiling a chicken, and there were lemons for tea on the table. After they had \\nbeen in our apartment, both the chicken and the lemons were gone. That\\'s \\nenough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment, people who don\\'t\\neven know anything about books. They didn\\'t take a single book, but they did \\ntake worn clothing, food, and even the cheapest of the cheap, worn-out \\nslippers.\\n\\nOf those whom I identified, four were Kafan Azerbaijanis living in Sumgait. \\nBasically, the group that went seeking \"revenge\"--let\\'s use their word for \\nit--was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill-seekers. I talked with \\none of them. He had gray eyes, and somehow against the back-drop of all that \\nblack I remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes. Besides taking\\npart in the pogrom of our apartment, he was also involved in the murder of \\nTamara Mekhtiyeva from Building 16. She was an older Armenian who had recently\\narrived from Georgia, she lived alone and did not have anyone in Sumgait. I \\ndon\\'t know why she had a last name like that, maybe she was married to an \\nAzerbaijani. I had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice, and know \\nnothing about her. I do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an \\naxe. Murdering her wasn\\'t enough for them. They hacked her into pieces and \\nthrew them into the tub with water.\\n\\nI remember another guy really well too, he was also rather fair-skinned. You \\nknow, all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark, both \\ntheir hair and their skin. And in contrast with them, in addition to the grey-\\neyed one, I remember this one fellow, the one l took to be a Lezgin. I \\nidentified him. As it turned out he was Eduard Robertovich Grigorian, born\\nin the city of Sumgait, and he had been convicted twice. One of our own. How \\ndid I remember him? The name Rita was tattooed on his left or right hand. I \\nkept thinking, is that Rita or \"puma,\" which it would be if you read the word \\nas Latin characters instead of Cyrillic, because the Cyrillic \"T\" was the one \\nthat looks like a Latin \"M.\" When they led him in he sat with his hands behind\\nhis back. This was at the confrontation. He swore on every holy book, tried to\\nput in an Armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion, and \\ntold me that I was making a mistake, and called me \"dear sister.\" He said, \\n\"You\\'re wrong, how could I, an Armenian, raise my hand against my own, an \\nArmenian,\" and so on. He spoke so convincingly that even the investigator \\nasked me, \"Lyuda, are you sure it was he?\" I told him, \"I\\'ll tell you one more\\nidentifying mark. If I\\'m wrong I shall apologize and say I was mistaken. The \\nname Rita is tattooed on his left or right hand.\" He went rigid and became \\npale. They told him, \"Put your hands on the table.\" He put his hands on the\\ntable with the palms up. I said, \"Now turn your hands over,\" but he didn\\'t \\nturn his hands over. Now this infuriated me. If he had from the very start\\nacknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn\\'t wanted to do it, that they \\nforced him or something else, I would have treated him somewhat differently.\\nBut he insolently stuck to his story, \"No, I did not do anything, it wasn\\'t \\nme.\" When they turned his hands over the name Rita was in fact tattooed on his\\nhand. His face distorted and he whispered something wicked. I immediately flew\\ninto a rage. There was an ashtray on the table, a really heavy one, made out \\nof granite or something, very large, and it had ashes and butts in it. \\nCatching myself quite by surprise, I hurled that ashtray at him. But he ducked\\nand the ashtray hit the wall, and ashes and butts rained down on his head and \\nback. And he smiled. When he smiled it provoked me further. I don\\'t know how, \\nbut I jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or \\nstrangling him; I no longer remember which. When I jumped I caught the \\nmicrophone cord. The investigator was there, Tolya . . .I no longer recall his\\nlast name, and he says, \"Lyudochka, it\\'s a Japanese microphone! Please . . .\\n\" And shut off all the equipment on the spot, it was all being video taped. \\nThey took him away. I stayed, and they talked to me a little to calm me down, \\nbecause we needed to go on working, I only remember Tolya telling me, \"You\\'re \\nsome actress! What a performance!\" I said, \"Tolya, honestly . . . \" Beforehand\\nthey would always tell me, \"Lyuda, more emotion. You speak as calmly as if \\nnothing had happened to you.\" I say, \"I don\\'t have any more strength or \\nemotion. All my emotions are behind me now, I no longer have the strength \\n. . . I don\\'t have the strength to do anything.\" And he says, \"Lyuda, how were\\nyou able to do that?\" And when I returned to normal, drinking tea and watching\\nthe tape, I said, \"Can I really have jumped over that table? I never jumped \\nthat high in gym class.\"\\n\\nSo you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international. Of \\nthe 36 we identified there was an Armenian, a Russian, Vadim Vorobyev, who \\nbeat Mamma, and 34 Azerbaijanis.\\n\\nAt the second meeting with Grigorian, when he had completely confessed his \\nguilt, he told of how on February 27 the Azerbaijanis had come knocking. Among\\nthem were guys--if you can call them guys--he knew from prison. They said, \\n\"Tomorrow we\\'re going after the Armenians. Meet us at the bus station at three\\no\\'clock.\" He said, \"No, I\\'m not coming.\" They told him, \"If you don\\'t come \\nwe\\'ll kill you.\" He said, \"Alright, I\\'ll come.\" And he went.\\n\\nThey also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict, Kamo Pogosian. He\\nhad also been in prison; I think that together they had either stolen a \\nmotorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed. They called him \\nout of his apartment and told him the same thing: \"Tomorrow we\\'re going to get\\nthe Armenians. Be there.\" He said, \"No.\" They pulled a knife on him. He said, \\n\"I\\'m not going all the same.\" And in the courtyard on the 27th they stabbed \\nhim several times, in the stomach. He was taken to the hospital. I know he was\\nin the hospital in Baku, in the Republic hospital. If we had known about that \\nwe would have had some idea of what was to come on the 28th.\\n\\nI\\'ll return to Grigorian, what he did in our apartment. I remember that he\\nbeat me along with all the rest. He spoke Azerbaijani extremely well. But he\\nwas very fair-skinned, maybe that led me to think that they had it out for\\nhim, too. But later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning\\nof Shagen Sargisian. I don\\'t know if he participated in the rapes in our \\napartment; I didn\\'t see, I don\\'t remember. But the people who were in our \\napartment who didn\\'t yet know that he was an Armenian said that he did. I \\ndon\\'t know if he confessed or not, and I myself don\\'t recall because I blacked\\nout very often. But I think that he didn\\'t participate in the rape of Karina\\nbecause he was in the apartment the whole time. When they carried her into the\\ncourtyard, he remained in the apartment.\\n\\nAt one point I was talking with an acquaintance about Edik Grigorian. From her\\nI learned that his wife was a dressmaker, his mother is Russian, he doesn\\'t \\nhave a father, and that he\\'s been convicted twice. Well this will be his third\\nand, I hope, last sentence. He beat his wife, she was eternally coming to work\\nwith bruises. His wife was an Armenian by the name of Rita.\\n\\nThe others who were detained . . . well they\\'re little beasts. You really can\\'t\\ncall them beasts, they\\'re just little beasts. They were robots carrying out\\nsomeone else\\'s will, because at the investigation they all said, \"I don\\'t \\nunderstand how I could have done that, I was out of my head.\" But we know that\\nthey were won around to it and prepared for it, that\\'s why they did it. In the\\nname of Allah, in the name of the Koran, in the name of propagating Islam--\\nthat\\'s holy to them--that\\'s why they did everything they were commanded to do.\\nBecause I saw they didn\\'t have minds of their own, I\\'m not talking about their\\nlevel of cultural sophistication or any higher values. No education, they\\nwork, have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly, they \\ncrowd them in, like at the temporary housing, and apparently, they were \\npromised that if they slaughtered the Armenians they would receive apartments.\\nSo off they went. Many of them explained their participation saying, \"they \\npromised us apartments.\"\\n\\nAmong them was one who genuinely repented. I am sure that he repented from the\\nheart and that he just despised himself after the incident. He worked at a \\nchildren\\'s home, an Azerbaijani, he has two children, and his wife works at \\nthe children\\'s home too. Everything that they acquired, everything that they \\nhave they earned by their own labor, and wasn\\'t inherited from parents or \\ngrandparents. And he said, \"I didn\\'t need anything I just don\\'t know . . . how\\nI ended up in that; it was like some hand was guiding me. I had no will of my \\nown, I had no strength, no masculine dignity, nothing.\" And the whole time I\\nkept repeating, \"Now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife \\nright before your own eyes.\" He sat there and just wailed.\\n\\nBut that leader in the Eskimo dogskin coat was not detained. He performed a \\nmarvelous disappearing act, but I think that they\\'ll get onto him, they just \\nhave to work a little, because that Vadim, that boy, according to his\\ngrandfather, is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do, how \\nto cover his tracks. He was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he \\nknew and those he didn\\'t, either, and other things as well, and changed \\nhimself like a chameleon so they wouldn\\'t get onto him, but he was detained.\\n\\nThat one in the Eskimo dogskin coat was at the Gambarians\\' after Aleksandr \\nGambarian was murdered. He came in and said, \"Let\\'s go, enough, you\\'ve spilled\\nenough blood here.\"\\n\\nMaybe Karina doesn\\'t know this but the reason they didn\\'t finish her off was \\nthat they were hoping to take her home with them. I heard this from Aunt Tanya\\nand her sons, the Kasumovs, who were in the courtyard near the entryway. They \\nliked her very much, and they had decided to take her to home with them. When \\nKarina came to at one point--she doesn\\'t remember this yet, this the neighbors \\nold me--and she saw that there was no one around her, she started crawling to \\nthe entryway. They saw that she was still alive and came back, they were \\nalready at the third entryway, on their way to the Gambarians\\'. They came back\\nand started beating her to finish her. If she had not come to she would have \\nsustained lesser bodily injuries, they would have beat her less. An older \\nwoman from our building, Aunt Nazan, an Azerbaijani, all but lay on top of \\nKarina, crying and pleading that they leave her alone, but they flung her off.\\nThe woman\\'s grown sons were right nearby; they picked her up in their hands \\nand led her home. She howled and cried out loudly and swore: God is on Earth, \\nhe sees everything, and He won\\'t forgive this.\\n\\nThere was another woman, too, Aunt Fatima, a sick, aging woman from the first \\nfloor, she\\'s already retired. Mountain dwellers, and Azerbaijanis, too, have a\\ncustom: If men are fighting, they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them.\\nBut they trampled her scarf and sent her home. To trample a scarf is \\ntantamount to trampling a woman\\'s honor.\\n\\nNow that the investigation is going on, now that a lot is behind us and we \\nhave gotten back to being ourselves a little, I think about how could these \\nevents that are now called the Sumgait tragedy happen? How did they come \\nabout? How did it start? Could it have been avoided? Well, it\\'s clear that \\nwithout a signal, without permission from the top leadership, it would not \\nhave happened. All the same, I\\'m not afraid to say this, the Azerbaijanis,\\nlet other worthy people take no offense, the better representatives of their \\nnations, let them take no offense, but the Azerbaijanis in their majority are \\na people who are kept in line only by fear of the law, fear of retribution for\\nwhat they have done. And when the law said that they could do all that, like\\nunleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn\\'t have time to do everything, they \\nthrew themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done,\\nto snatch a bit more. The smell of the danger was already in the air on\\nFebruary 27. You could tell that something was going to happen. And everyone \\nwho had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs. Many left\\nfor their dachas, got plane tickets for the other end of the country, just got\\nas far away as their legs would carry them.\\n\\nFebruary 27 was a Saturday. I was teaching my third class. The director came \\ninto my classroom and said that I should let the children out, that there had \\nbeen a call from the City Party Committee asking that all teachers gather for \\na meeting at Lenin Square. Well, I excused the children, and there were few \\nteachers left at school, altogether three women, the director, and six or \\nseven men. The rest had already gone home. We got to Lenin Square and there \\nwere a great many people there. This was around five-thirty or six in the \\nevening, no later. They were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and \\nthe crowd below was supporting them stormily, roaring. They spoke over the \\nmicrophone about what had happened in Kafan a few days earlier and that the \\ndriver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small Azerbaijani\\nchild off the bus. The speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness, that he had\\nseen it himself..The crowd started to rage: \"Death to the Armenians! They must\\nbe killed!\" Then a woman went up on stage. I didn\\'t see the woman because \\npeople were clinging to the podium like flies. I could only hear her. The \\nwoman introduced herself as coming from Kafan, and said that the Armenians \\ncut her daughters\\' breasts off, and called, \"Sons, avenge my daughters!\" That \\nwas enough. A portion of the people on the square took off running in the \\ndirection of the factories, toward the beginning of Lenin Street.\\n\\nWe stood there about an hour. Then the director of School 25 spoke, he gave a \\nvery nationalist speech. He said, \"Brother Muslims, kill the Armenians!\" This \\nhe repeated every other sentence. When he said this the crowd supported him \\nstormily, whistling and shouting \"Karabagh!\" He said, \"Karabagh has been our \\nterritory my whole life long, Karabagh is my soul. How can you tear out my \\nheart?\" As though an Azerbaijani would die without Karabagh. \"It\\'s our \\nterritory, the Armenians will never see it. The Armenians must be eliminated. \\nFrom time immemorial Muslims have cleansed the land of infidel Armenians, from\\ntime immemorial, that\\'s the way nature created it, that every 20 to 30 years \\nthe Azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth.\" By filth he meant \\nArmenians.\\n\\nI heard this. Before that I hadn\\'t been listening to the speeches closely.\\nMany people spoke and I stood with my back to the podium, talking shop with \\nthe other teachers, and somehow it all went right by, it didn\\'t penetrate,\\nthat in fact something serious was taking place. Then, when one of our\\nteachers said, \"Listen to what he\\'s saying, listen to what idiocy he\\'s \\nspouting,\" we listened. That was the speech of that director. Before that we \\nlistened to the woman\\'s speech.\\n\\nRight then in our group--there were nine of us--the mood changed, and the \\nsubject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten. Our director of\\nstudies, for whom I had great respect, he\\'s an Azerbaijani . . . Before that I\\nhad considered him an upstanding and worthy person, if there was a need to \\nobtain leave we had asked him, he seemed like a good person. So he tells me,\\n\"Lyuda, you know that besides you there are no Armenians on the square? If \\nthey find out that you\\'re an Armenian they\\'ll tear you to pieces. Should I \\ntell them you\\'re an Armenian? Should I tell them you\\'re an Armenian?\" When he \\nsaid it the first time I pretended not to hear it, and then he asked me a \\nsecond time. I turned to the director, Khudurova, and said that it was already\\nafter eight, I was expected at home, and I should be leaving. She answered, \\n\"No, they said that women should stay here until ten o\\'clock,.and men, until \\ntwelve. Stay here.\" There was a young teacher with us, her children were in \\nkindergarten and her husband worked shifts. She asked to leave: \"I left my \\nchildren at the kindergarten.\" The director excused her. When she let her go I\\nturned around, said, \"Good-bye,\" and left with the young teacher, the \\nAzerbaijani. I didn\\'t see them after that.\\n\\nWhen we were walking the buses weren\\'t running, and a crowd from the rally ran\\nnearby us. They had apparently gotten all fired up. It must have become too \\nmuch for them, and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately, so they rushed \\noff. I wasn\\'t afraid this time because I was sure that the other teacher \\nwouldn\\'t say that I was an Armenian.\\n\\nTo make it short, we reached home. Then Karina told of how they had been at \\nthe movies and what had happened there. I started telling of my experience and\\nagain my parents didn\\'t understand that we were in danger. We watched \\ntelevision as usual, and didn\\'t even imagine that tomorrow would be our last \\nday. That\\'s how it all was.\\n\\nAt the City Party Committee I met an acquaintance, we went to school together,\\nZhanna, I don\\'t remember her last name, she lives above the housewares store \\non Narimanov Street. She was there with her father, for some reason she \\ndoesn\\'t have a mother. The two of them were at home alone. While her father \\nheld the door she jumped from the third floor, and she was lucky that the \\nground was wet and that there wasn\\'t anyone behind the building when she went \\nout on the balcony, there was no one there, they were all standing near the \\nentryway. That building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders \\nthere. She jumped. She jumped and didn\\'t feel any pain in the heat of the \\nmoment. A few days later I found out that she couldn\\'t stand up, she had been \\ninjured somehow. That\\'s how people in Sumgait saved their lives, their honor, \\nand their children: any way they could. \\n\\nWhere it was possible, the Armenians fought back. My father\\'s first cousin, \\nArmen M., lives in Block 30. They found out by phone from one of the victims \\nwhat was going on in town. The Armenians in that building all called one \\nanother immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes, knives, even \\nwith muskets and went up to the roof. They took their infants with them, and \\ntheir old women who had been in bed for God knows how many months, they got \\nthem right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs. They hooked \\nelectricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited, ready to fight. Then \\nthey took the daughter of the school board director hostage, she\\'s an \\nAzerbaijani who lived in their building. They called the school board director\\nand told her that if she didn\\'t help them, the 17 Armenians on the roof, to \\nescape alive and unharmed, she\\'d never see her daughter again. I\\'m sure, of \\ncourse, that Armenians would never lay a hand on a woman, it was just the only\\nthing that could have saved them at the time. She called the police. The \\nArmenians made a deal with the local police to go into town. Two armored \\npersonnel carriers and soldiers were summoned They surrounded the entryway and\\nled everyone down from the roof, and off to the side from the armored \\npersonnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that \\nvery moment, into Block 30. That\\'s how they defended themselves.\\n\\nI heard that our neighbors, Roman and Sasha Gambarian, resisted. They\\'re big, \\nstrong guys. Their father was killed. And I heard that the brothers put up a \\nstrong defense and lost their father, but were able to save their mother.\\n\\nOne of the neighbors told me that after it happened, when they were looking \\nfor the criminals on March 1 to 2 and detaining everyone they suspected, \\npeople hid people in our entryway, maybe people who were injured or perhaps \\ndead. The neighbors themselves were afraid to go there, and when they went \\nwith the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found \\nAzerbaijani corpses. I don\\'t know how many. Even if they had been wounded and \\nput down there, after two days they would have died from loss of blood or \\ninfection--that basement was filled with water. I heard this from the \\nneighbors. And later when I was talking with the investigators the subject \\ncame up and they confirmed it. I know, too, that for several hours the \\nbasement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment. And our neighbor\\ncarried out our carpet, along with the rest: he stole it for himself, posing \\nas one of the criminals. Everyone was taking his own share, and the neighbor \\ntook his, too, and carried it home. And when we came back, when everything \\nseemed to have calmed down, he returned it, saying that it was the only thing \\nof ours he had managed to \"save.\"\\n\\nRaya\\'s husband and father defended themselves. The Trdatovs defended \\nthemselves, and so did other Armenian families. To be sure there were\\nAzerbaijani victims, although we\\'ll never hear anything about them. For some \\nreason our government doesn\\'t want to say that the Armenians were not just \\nvictims, but that they defended the honor of their sisters and mothers, too. \\nIn the TV show \"Pozitsiya\" [Viewpoint] a military man, an officer, said that \\nthe Armenians did virtually nothing to defend themselves. But that\\'s not \\nimportant, the truth will come out regardless.\\n\\nSo that\\'s the price we paid those three days. For three days our courage, our \\nbravery, and our humanity was tested. It was those three days, and not the \\nyears and dozens of years we had lived before them, that showed what we\\'ve \\nbecome, what we grew up to be. Those three days showed who was who.\\n\\nOn that I will conclude my narrative on the Sumgait tragedy. It should be said\\nthat it\\'s not over yet, the trials are still ahead of us, and the punishments\\nreceived by those who so violated us, who wanted to make us into nonhumans \\nwill depend on our position and on the work of the investigators, the \\nProcuracy, and literally of every person who lent his hand to the investiga-\\ntion. That\\'s the price we paid to live in Armenia, to not fear going out on \\nthe street at night, to not be afraid to say we\\'re Armenians, and to not fear\\nspeaking our native tongue.\\n\\n   October 15,1988\\n   Yerevan\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t- - - reference for #008 - - -\\n\\n[1] _The Sumgait Tragedy; Pogroms against Armenians in Soviet Azerbaijan,\\n    Volume I, Eyewitness Accounts_, edited by Samuel Shahmuradian, forward by\\n    Yelena Bonner, 1990, published by Aristide D.

Ahola had\\nonly played 50 games this season (I think it\\'s actually less; the San Jose\\nMercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he\\nhas played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn\\'t been\\nspectacular, and his offense isn\\'t anything to write home about (8 points);\\nit\\'s even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn\\nout to be ... Peter Ahola.\\n\\n#24\\tDOUG WILSON\\t\\tSeason: 16th\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and\\n\\t\\t2nd round pick in \\'92 entry draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B)\\n\\nI have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high\\nexpectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.\\nNevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and\\nplaymaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,\\nunfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to\\ncatch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for\\n2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be\\nWilson\\'s last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.\\n\\n#29\\tDEAN KOLSTAD\\t\\tSeason:\\t2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (C-/D+)\\n\\nIt\\'s probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of\\ngames (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he\\'s\\nquickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,\\nhe did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of\\nthe first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with\\nthe Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward\\nwith his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in\\nhis level of performance to have any chance of making the team.\\n\\n#38\\tPAT MACLEOD\\t\\tSeason: 2nd\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (?)\\n\\nMacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my\\nmemory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to\\nuse him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that\\nhe wouldn\\'t clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with\\nKansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,\\na \"rehab assignment\" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.\\nSince he has played so little, I can\\'t even give a tentative grade on him, but\\nhe demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive\\nskills.\\n\\n#41\\tTOM PEDERSON\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (B+)\\n\\nCalled up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated\\nby injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours\\ntruly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in\\n43 games.  However, his size (5\\' 9\", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after\\nhe began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,\\non both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.\\nBut to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance\\non surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.\\n\\n#45\\tCLAUDIO SCREMIN\\t\\tSeason: 1st\\nAcquired:\\t\\'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft\\nGrade:\\t\\tI (D+/D)\\n\\nHe played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly\\numimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a\\nsmall sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is\\nquickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or\\ndefense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that\\nwill go down in Scremin\\'s entry of league stats is probably the fact that he\\nwas once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.\\n\\n===============================================================================\\nGO CALGARY FLAMES!

Some of what I \\nwould complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may \\nnever have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - \\nunsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars \\nas profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and \\na pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time \\n- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. \\nAny lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  \\nWhole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there \\nand becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief \\nin an afterlife.  \\n\\nThe Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks \\nand Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light \\ncrossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people \\nis still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating \\nthe scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or \\nthousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  \\nBut there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. \\n\\nYes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live \\nin a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport \\ncurrently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The \\nimpact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists \\nthat has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped \\ninto shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life \\nforms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels \\n(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains \\none weekend, \"getting away from it all\" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, \\nmalls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed \\nthe hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 \\nmiles to the east.  (Their \\'security light\\' didn\\'t help matters \\nmuch either.)  But I\\'ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of \\nhigh air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. \\n\\nBut there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn\\'t \\nfouled in some way.  (I mean they\\'ve been TRYING this forever - \\nlike, concerning Tesla\\'s idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don\\'t watch \\ncommercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, \\ntruck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  \\nIf ya\\' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at \\nleast consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last\\nbeautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  \\n\\nTo be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage \\nof HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at \\n8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the \\nlocal meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I\\'ll be trying to see it \\nif I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could \\nbe called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky \\nwhile complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that \\nas it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, \\neven if it can\\'t ever be perfectly achieved. \\n\\nRegards, \\nWm. Hathaway \\nBaltimore MD \\n',\n",

Meanwhile, military and commercial \\nusers have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \\nconstellation.  \\n\\nFirstly, different functions are broken down into different \\nconstellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:\\nthus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,\\ncomsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task\\nis distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\\nproviding for redundancy and full coverage where needed.\\n\\nSSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments\\nand are also prime candidates for constellization.\\n\\n[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:\\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for\\nshort-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is\\ninexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities \\non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\\nto a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \\ninteresting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \\nor gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can\\nbe much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a \\nstation is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.\\n\\n[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,\\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation\\nenvironments of deep space instead of the protected shelter\\nof LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since\\nastronauts will have little practical use in the space program\\nuntil costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using\\nastronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,\\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\\ntether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity\\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the\\nradiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,\\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support\\nmachinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR\\ninterface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,\\nfollow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,\\ntesting out the actual environment at low cost before $billions\\nare spent on astronauts.\\n\\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in \\nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated\\nrobots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can\\npractice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck\\nsolar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,\\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be\\nspun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat\\ncompanies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.\\n\\nBy applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting\\nrid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we\\nhave radically improved the capability of the program while\\ngreatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,\\nwe can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study\\nlife's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \\nof space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum\\nresearch inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose\\norbits.\\n\\nN.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration\\nas well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  \\nMars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously \\nwe can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used\\nto fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and\\nsample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can\\nbe used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology\\ngreenhouses on Mars at low cost.\\n\\n\\n-- \\nNick Szabo\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t szabo@techboook.com\\n\",\n",

Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom \\n played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up\\n Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge\\n to Sweden in creating more opportunities.\\n Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi\\n made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but\\n Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada\\n started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked\\n hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson\\n who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and\\n made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.\\n The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot\\n that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.\\n Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took\\n a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by\\n the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.\\n Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure\\n but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.\\n At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to\\n cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.\\n That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in \\n the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he\\n explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close\\n to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.\\n Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a\\n bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas\\n then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.\\n The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a\\n rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds\\n in the dressing room.\\n\\n A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing\\n great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better\\n than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best\\n goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.\\n Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is\\n easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,\\n Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.\\n\\n The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-\\n Nilsson.

That means if the Isles\\nbeat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.\\n\\n\\tHowever, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in\\ngeneral that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders \\nback-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that \\nthe Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,\\ncome on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable\\nhow many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty \\nwide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played \\na golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL \\ndebut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this \\nguy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a \\nMahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it\\'s because the Isles don\\'t shoot \\ncorrectly.  Has anyone else noticed this?\\n\\n\\tAlso, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick\\nVukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey\\ntalent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the\\npuck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. \\nRichard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he\\'s a\\ndefenseman.  He\\'s got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. \\nThis guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such \"enforcers\"?  Not\\nonly do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are\\nreally trying to play the game.  I\\'ll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a \\ngood fight once in a while, but only when it\\'s \"called for\".  You know, when a\\nguy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of \"hockey ethics\"\\nmight cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are\\nlosing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees\\nneed to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. \\nI\\'m sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the\\nreferee doesn\\'t call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,\\nnot physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. \\nIf you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to\\npull a guy down to prevent it, you don\\'t deserve to win in the first place.\\n\\nJust My Honest Opinion,\\n\\nGary at Hofstra\\nACCGSG@VAXB.HOFSTRA.EDU\\nACCGSG@HOFSTRA.BITNET\\n',\n",

By your\\ncriteria *everyone* should stay away from the negotiations.\\n\\nThat is precisely why the Palestinians (in their recent PISGA proposal for \\nthe \"interim\" period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy) are\\ndemanding conditions that essentially define \"autonomy\" already.

Why should they trust the Arab/Palestinians\\' words?\\nSince they don\\'t, they are VERY reluctant to give up \"tangible assets \\n(land, control of areas) in exchange for \"words\".

Many sites are listed as\\n    providing \\'anonymous FTP\\'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on\\n    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP\\n    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via\\n    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com\\n    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions\\n    on how to make requests.\\n\\n    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames\\n    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.\\n\\n    Don\\'t even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is\\n    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.\\n\\n\\nVIEWING IMAGES\\n\\n    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly\\n    large, and I won\\'t attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To\\n    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,\\n    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu\\n    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP\\n    sites.\\n\\n    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image\\n    formats and how to get image viewing software.

Please\\n    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.\\n\\n    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in\\n    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the\\n    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).\\n\\n    To access the archives by email, send a letter to\\n    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the\\n    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:\\n\\n\\tsend SPACE Index\\n\\tsend SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.\\n\\n    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in\\n    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use\\n    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this\\n    section for images or programs.\\n\\n    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image\\n    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The\\n    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are\\n    available in these collections.\\n\\n    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory\\n    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in\\n    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is\\n    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item \"VIEWING IMAGES\" below).\\n\\n    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to\\n    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing\\n    specific information.

Fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, to\\neducation, to establish a family and have children, to human\\ndignity, the right to free movement, to free expression, etc. are\\nmore important to human existence that the rights of states.\\n\\n2.      In the event of a conflict between basic human rights and\\nrights of collectivities, basic human rights should prevail.\\n\\n3.      Between the collectivities defining themselves as\\nJewish-Israeli and Palestinian-Arab, however labelled, an\\nunresolved conflict exists.\\n\\n4.      This conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of\\npeople. It moreover poisons relations between communities, peoples\\nand nations.\\n\\n5.      Each year, the United States expends billions of dollars\\nin economic and military aid to the conflicting parties.\\n\\n6.      Attempts to solve the Israeli-Arab conflict by traditional\\npolitical means have failed.\\n\\n7.      As long as the conflict is perceived as that between two\\ndistinct ethnical/religious communities/peoples which claim the\\nland, there is no just nor peaceful solution possible.\\n\\n8.      Love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake\\nof peace and justice. When people love, they share.\\n\\nHaving stated my assumptions, I will now state my proposal.\\n\\n1.      A Fund should be established which would disburse grants\\nfor each child born to a couple where one partner is Israeli-Jew\\nand the other Palestinian-Arab.\\n\\n2.      To be entitled for a grant, a couple will have to prove\\nthat one of the partners possesses or is entitled to Israeli\\ncitizenship under the Law of Return and the other partner,\\nalthough born in areas under current Isreali control, is not\\nentitled to such citizenship under the Law of Return.\\n\\n3.      For the first child, the grant will amount to $18.000. For\\nthe second the third child, $12.000 for each child. For each\\nsubsequent child, the grant will amount to $6.000 for each child.\\n\\n\\n4.      The Fund would be financed by a variety of sources which\\nhave shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the\\nIsraeli-Arab conflict, including the U.S. Government, Jewish and\\nChristian organizations in the U.S.  and a great number of\\ngovernments and international organizations.\\n\\n5.      The emergence of a considerable number of 'mixed'\\nmarriages in Israel/Palestine, all of whom would have relatives on\\n'both sides' of the divide, would make the conflict lose its\\nethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a\\ntruly civil society. The existence of a strong 'mixed' stock of\\npeople would also help the integration of Israeli society into the\\nMiddle-East in a graceful manner.\\n\\nObjections to this proposal will certainly be voiced. I will\\nattempt to identify some of these:\\n\\n1.      The idea of providing financial incentives to selected\\nforms of partnership and marriage, is not conventional. However,\\nit is based on the concept of affirmative action, which is\\nrecognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the\\nperverse effects of segregation and discrimination. International\\nlaw clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at\\nreducing racial discrimination and segregation.\\n\\n2.      It may be objected that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict\\nis not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict, but that it is\\na conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous\\ncolonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed\\nstruggle. This objection is based on the assumption that the\\n'enemy' is not Zionism as ideology and practice, but\\nIsraeli-Jewish society and its members which will have to be\\ndefeated. This objection has no merit because it does not fulfill\\nthe first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental\\nhuman rights over collective rights (see above)\\n\\n3.      Fundamentalist Jews would certainly object to the use of\\nfinancial incentives to encourage 'mixed marriages'. From their\\npoint of view, the continued existence of a specific Jewish People\\noverrides any other consideration, be it human love, peace of\\nhuman rights.  The President of the World Jewish Congress, Edgar\\nBronfman, reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he\\ngave to Der Spiegel, a German magazine. He called the increasing\\nassimilation of Jews in the world a <calamity>, comparable in its\\neffects only with the Holocaust. This objection has no merit\\neither because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions (see\\nabove)\\n\\n4.      It may objected that only a few people in\\nIsrael/Palestine, would request such grants and that it would thus\\nnot serve its purpose. To this objection one might respond that\\nalthough it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect\\nof such a proposal, the existence of such a Fund would help mixed\\ncouples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and\\nencourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist\\nattitudes.\\n\\n5.      It may objected that such a Fund would need great sums to\\nbring about substantial demographic changes. This objection has\\nmerits. However, it must be remembered that huge sums, more than\\n$3 billion, are expended each year by the United States government\\nand by U.S. organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the\\nMiddle-East through armaments. A mere fraction of these sums would\\nsuffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable\\nclimate towards the existence of 'mixed' marriages in\\nIsrael/Palestine, thus encouraging the emergence of a\\nnon-segregated society in that worn-torn land.\\n\\nI would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as\\nwell for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful\\ndiscussion and enrichment.\\n\\nElias Davidsson Post Box 1760 121 Reykjavik, ICELAND\\n\\n\",\n",

The main legal principles of the Turkish State \\nare summarized in Article 2 of the Constitution:\\n\\n\\t\"The Republic of Turkey is a democratic, secular and social State\\n\\tgoverned by the rule of law; bearing in mind the concepts of public\\n\\tpeace, national solidarity and justice; respecting human rights;\\n\\tloyal to the nationalism of Ataturk, and based on the fundamental\\n\\ttenets set forth in the Preamble of the Constitution.\"\\n\\nFreedom of culture and religion prevailed during the Ottoman Empire, allowing\\nthe many nations and races within its boundaries to remain autonomous. The\\nfact that the Ottoman Empire was the longest lived in recent history may be\\nattributed to these freedoms, despite the lack of any written Constitution.\\nThe first attempts to create a written Constitution occurred in 1839 and 1856.\\nAlthough the documents adopted during these two attempts remained in force\\nonly temporarily, they provided the basic elements of a Constitution.\\n\\nThe 1876 Constitution was the first legal document to force a Parliament and\\nthe right of election to share the sovereignty of the Emperor. The Constitution\\nof 1906 placed some additional limitations on the Emperor, while increasing\\nthe power of the Parliament and the government.\\n\\nThe First World War (1914-1918) brought the Ottoman Empire to an end. By the\\noccupation of Istanbul, the Parliament was dissolved and the Constitution was\\nabolished. The members of Parliament were sent to exile to an island by the\\noccupying forces.\\n\\nDuring the Independence War, the \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" held their\\nfirst meeting on April 23, 1920 to serve as the legislative body of the new\\nTurkish state. This assembly prepared the new legal structure of the Turkish\\nRepublic. The new Republic was proclaimed on October 29, 1923 and the new\\nConstitution was adopted in 1924. That Constitution served as the legal \\nbackbone of today\\'s modern Turkish Republic. In 1945, Turkey adopted a \\nmulti-party political system. The Constitution of 1924 was replaced by\\nothers in 1961 and 1982. All three Constitutions of the Republic have been\\nbased on the principles of parliamentary democracy, human rights, national\\nsovereignty, division of powers, private ownership and secularization.\\n\\n\"Major Principles of the Constitution\"\\n\\nThe constitution (with 177 Articles) establishes the structure of the Republic\\nwithin the following principles:\\n\\n- The Turkish Republic is a democratic, secular and social state governed by \\n  law;\\n- It should be governed to maintain public peace, national solidarity, justice,\\n  human rights and the objectives of Ataturk;\\n- The language of the State is Turkish;\\n- Sovereignty is vested in the nation without any conditions or restrictions.\\n  Sovereignty is exercised by organizations authorized by the nation;\\n- Legislative power is carried by the Parliament elected by the nation. This\\n  power cannot be delegated (transferred) to any one else;\\n- Executive power is exercised by the President, and Council of Ministers;\\n- Judicial power is exercised by the independent courts on behalf of the\\n  Turkish nation;\\n- All individuals are equal, irrespective of language, race, religion, color,\\n  sex, or political beliefs;\\n- Laws cannot be contradict those principles stated in the Constitution.\\n\\n\"Structure of the State\"\\n\\nIn accordance with the Constitution, the structure of the state is based on the\\nprinciple of \"division of power\" to create a balanced and self-controlled\\nsystem. The power is divided into \"legislative power,\" \"executive power,\" and\\n\"judicial power,\" balanced to secure freedoms and powers to control each\\nother (self-control).\\n\\n A. Legislative Power:\\n\\n The \"Turkish Grand National Assembly\" is a parliament with one House, elected\\n by the nation for a term of five years to exercise legislative power on\\n behalf of the nation. The basic functions of this Assembly are:\\n\\n - to adopt, to amend, or to repeal laws;\\n - to approve or to dismiss the Council of Ministers;\\n - to supervise and to question Ministers or the Council of Ministers;\\n - to debate, to amend and to approve annual budgets;\\n - to ratify international agreements;\\n - to grant amnesty or pardons.\\n\\n Members of Parliament do not have any liability for their words (either oral\\n or written) during the course of their legislative duties. The country is\\n divided into constituencies. The number of representatives of each is\\n calculated according to its population. Every Turkish citizen over the age\\n of twenty-one can vote.\\n\\n Elections are supervised by the \"Supreme Council of Elections,\" which solves\\n all disputes or appeals. In each province, the local \"Board of Election\"\\n runs and controls the election under the supervision and guidelines of the\\n Supreme Council. Members of the Council and Boards are elected among \\n independent judges.\\n\\n B. Executive Power:\\n\\n The President of the Republic is the Head of State (not the head of government\\n as in the Unites States). The main functions of the President are:\\n\\n - to represent the State and the Country;\\n - to insure the implementation of the Constitution;\\n - to coordinate legislative, judicial and executive functions;\\n - act as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces;\\n - to ratify laws and government decrees.\\n \\n The President is elected by the Grand National Assembly for a period of seven\\n years. The President may ratify or return the laws for a second debate, may \\n call for a referendum.\\n\\n Executive power is exercised by the \"Council of Ministers,\" headed by the\\n Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is appointed by the President from the\\n members of Parliament. The Prime Minister names the Ministers for approval\\n by the President. The new Government (Council of Ministers) reads their\\n program at the Parliament and the vote of confidence follows. There are 21 (?)\\n Ministers in the Council.\\n\\n Ministers and other members of the administration can be sued in independent\\n \"administrative\" courts for their misuse of power, administrative errors or\\n functions against any law.\\n\\n C. Judicial Power:\\n\\n Judicial power is exercised by independent courts. No authority or power can\\n instruct the judges or public prosecutors of the courts.

Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.\\n\\nThe day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy\\nMarshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although\\nSpence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy\\nmust involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is\\nthe government\\'s only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.\\nSpence attacked Cooper\\'s credibility by pointing out discrepancies\\nbetween Cooper\\'s statements last September and those made in court.\\nCooper conceded that, \"You have all these things compressed into\\na few seconds...It\\'s difficult to remember what went on first.\"\\n\\nCooper acknowledged that he carried a \"9mm Colt Commando submachine\\ngun with a silenced barrel.\" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]\\nCooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific\\nplans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver\\'s dog.\\n\\nWhen Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan\\'s\\nM-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for\\nsure that Degan did not return fire before going down.\\n\\nSpence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)\\nhad Cooper discussed last August\\'s events, Cooper responded, \"If\\nyou\\'re implying that we got our story together, you\\'re wrong,\\ncounselor.\"  Spence continued to advance the defense\\'s version of\\nthe events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by\\nkilling the Weaver\\'s dog.  Cooper disagreed.\\n\\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence\\'s\\nvirulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions\\nwere repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained \\nthat Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the\\ndefense\\'s version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge\\nsustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted\\nuntil Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to\\nadmonish both attorneys.  \"I\\'m not going to play games with either\\ncounsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start\\nacting like professionals.\"\\n\\nSpence told the judge that, \"When all the evidence is in, we\\'ll see\\nthat ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that\\nhe was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events.\" \\nSpence continued, \"We\\'re going to find...that there is a very unlikely\\nsimilarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between\\nthe testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.\"\\n\\nSpence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen\\'s repeated\\nobjections would prevent a fair trial, \"We can\\'t have a fair trial if the\\njury believes I\\'m some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I\\'m\\nbending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I\\'m\\nviolating court orders.\"\\n\\nJudge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen\\'s\\nobjections had somehow prejudiced the jury was \"preposterous\" and\\ndenied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict\\nhis comments when objecting.\\n\\nThe trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg\\nRampton.  The prosecution\\'s purpose was simply to introduce five\\nweapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized\\non the opportunity to further address Cooper\\'s credibility.\\n\\nDefense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris\\' other attorney) questioned\\nRampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific\\nplans to kill the Weaver\\'s dog without being detected.  Matthews then\\nhad Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton\\nhad said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon\\nwas to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.\\nRampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,\\nbut he could not remember when.  He then stated that, \"I did not conduct\\nthe primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations\\nwith him since the interview was conducted.\"\\n\\nMonday, April 19, 1993 will begin the fifth day of the trial.

Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation\\n   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult\\n   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit\\n   of idiocy is that if you\\'re going to operate as a quasi-military unit,\\n   you\\'d better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule\\n   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is\\n   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.\\n\\n2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were\\n   outgunned, they didn\\'t expect such heavy resistance.  When\\n   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault\\n   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were\\n   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew\\n   you could!\\n\\n3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,\\n   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and\\n   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I\\'m\\n   more than ever convinced that\\'s right on target.  An anecdote not\\n   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up\\n   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There\\'s\\n   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by\\n   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I\\n   was told this by a relative of my wife\\'s who happens to be an FBI\\n   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let\\'s just say\\n   uncomplimentary.\\n\\n4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that\\n   the BD\\'s had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the\\n   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we\\'re *still* hearing\\n   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references\\n   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around\\n   the \"He\\'s a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!\"\\n   flag.  Sigh.\\n\\n5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege\\n   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought\\n   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button\\n   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My\\n   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to\\n   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to\\n   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in\\n   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I\\'d expect the\\n   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In\\n   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones\\n   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:\\n   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and\\n   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the\\n   BD\\'s feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have\\n   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.

Literally\\nTzeghagron means \\'to make a religion of one\\'s race.\\' The architect\\nof the Armenian Racial Patriots was Garegin Nezhdeh, a Nazi Armenian\\nwho became a key leader of collaboration with Hitler in World War II.\\nIn 1933, he had been invited to the United States by the Central\\nCommittee of the Dashnaktzoutun to inspire and organize the \\nAmerican-Armenian youth. Nezhdeh succeeded in unifying many local\\nArmenian youth groups in the Tzeghagrons. Starting with 20\\nchapters in the initial year, the Tzeghagrons grew to 60 chapters\\nand became the largest and most powerful Nazi Armenian organization.\\nNezhdeh also provided the Tzeghagrons with a philosophy:\\n\\n \"The Racial Religious beliefs in his racial blood as a deity.\\n  Race above everything and before everything.

Diplomats and aid\\nworkers say the death toll is in line with their own estimates.\\n\\nThe 25  February attack on Hojali  by Armenian forces was  one of\\nthe last moves  in their four-year campaign to  take full control\\nof Nagorny Karabakh,  the subject of a new  round of negotiations\\nin Rome on Monday. The bloodshed was something between a fighting\\nretreat and  a massacre, but  investigators say that most  of the\\ndead were civilians. The awful  number of people killed was first\\nsuppressed by  the fearful  former Communist government  in Baku.\\nLater  it  was blurred  by  Armenian  denials and  grief-stricken\\nAzerbaijan\\'s wild  and contradictory  allegations of up  to 2,000\\ndead.\\n\\nThe State Prosecuter, Aydin Rasulov,  the cheif investigator of a\\n15-man  team  looking  into  what Azerbaijan  calls  the  \"Hojali\\nDisaster\", said  his figure of 600  people dead was a  minimum on\\npreliminary  findings.  A similar  estimate  was  given by  Elman\\nMemmedov, the mayor of Hojali. An  even higher one was printed in\\nthe Baku newspaper  Ordu in May - 479 dead  people named and more\\nthan 200 bodies reported unidentified.  This figure of nearly 700\\ndead is quoted as official by Leila Yunusova, the new spokeswoman\\nof the Azeri Ministry of Defence.\\n\\nFranCois Zen  Ruffinen, head  of delegation of  the International\\nRed Cross  in Baku, said  the Muslim imam  of the nearby  city of\\nAgdam had reported a figure of  580 bodies received at his mosque\\nfrom  Hojali, most  of  them  civilians. \"We  did  not count  the\\nbodies. But  the figure seems  reasonable. It is no  fantasy,\" Mr\\nZen Ruffinen said. \"We have some idea since we gave the body bags\\nand products to wash the dead.\"\\n\\nMr  Rasulov endeavours  to give  an unemotional  estimate of  the\\nnumber of  dead in the  massacre. \"Don\\'t  get worked up.  It will\\ntake  several months  to  get a  final  figure,\" the  43-year-old\\nlawyer said at his small office.\\n\\nMr Rasulov  knows about these  things. It  took him two  years to\\nreach  a firm  conclusion that  131  people were  killed and  714\\nwounded  when  Soviet  troops  and tanks  crushed  a  nationalist\\nuprising in Baku in January 1990.\\n\\nThose  nationalists, the  Popular  Front, finally  came to  power\\nthree weeks  ago and  are applying pressure  to find  out exactly\\nwhat  happened when  Hojali, an  Azeri town  which lies  about 70\\nmiles from the border with Armenia, fell to the Armenians.\\n\\nOfficially, 184 people have so  far been certified as dead, being\\nthe  number of  people that  could be  medically examined  by the\\nrepublic\\'s forensic department. \"This  is just a small percentage\\nof the dead,\" said Rafiq Youssifov, the republic\\'s chief forensic\\nscientist. \"They were the only bodies brought to us. Remember the\\nchaos and the fact that we are  Muslims and have to wash and bury\\nour dead within 24 hours.\"\\n\\nOf these 184 people, 51 were women, and 13 were children under 14\\nyears old.  Gunshots killed  151 people,  shrapnel killed  20 and\\naxes or  blunt instruments  killed 10.  Exposure in  the highland\\nsnows killed the last three.  Thirty-three people showed signs of\\ndeliberate mutilation, including ears,  noses, breasts or penises\\ncut off and  eyes gouged out, according  to Professor Youssifov\\'s\\nreport. Those 184 bodies examined were less than a third of those\\nbelieved to have been killed, Mr Rasulov said.\\n\\nFiles  from  Mr  Rasulov\\'s  investigative  commission  are  still\\ndisorganised -  lists of 44  Azeri militiamen are dead  here, six\\npolicemen there,  and in handwriting  of a mosque  attendant, the\\nnames of  111 corpses brought to  be washed in just  one day. The\\nmost heartbreaking account from  850 witnesses interviewed so far\\ncomes  from Towfiq  Manafov,  an Azeri  investigator  who took  a\\nhelicopter  flight  over  the  escape route  from  Hojali  on  27\\nFebruary.\\n\\n\"There were too many bodies of  dead and wounded on the ground to\\ncount properly: 470-500  in Hojali, 650-700 people  by the stream\\nand the road and 85-100  visible around Nakhchivanik village,\" Mr\\nManafov  wrote in  a  statement countersigned  by the  helicopter\\npilot.\\n\\n\"People waved up  to us for help.

It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get\\n   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I\\n   was told by a police officer.\\n2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to\\n   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns\\n   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.\\n3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will\\n   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.\\n   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form\\n   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  \\n   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these\\n   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will\\n   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess\\n   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.\\n4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will\\n   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations\\n   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some \\n   manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.\\n   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)\\n\\nThis covers most of what we discussed.

To this day, \\nTurkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order \\nto cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, \\nwhich is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia \\ncontinues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:\\n\\n1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide\\nin order to shift international public opinion away from its political\\nresponsibility.\\n\\n2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism \\nTriangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish \\nGenocide.\\n\\n3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through\\nthe ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to \\nsilence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.\\n\\n4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet\\nArmenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through\\nterrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters\\nof the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.\\n\\nUsing all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government \\nis attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from\\nmaking the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.\\n\\nYet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its \\nterrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks \\nto the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically \\nexterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on \\nthis issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of \\ngovernments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition \\nof the Turkish Genocide.\\n\\nWith the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial\\ndemands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people\\nwill unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims\\nof the Turkish Genocide demand:\\n\\n1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian \\nDictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and\\nKurdish people;\\n\\n3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for \\ntheir heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;\\n\\n4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially\\nrecognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse\\nto succumb to all Armenian political pressure;\\n\\n5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it \\nhas adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially \\nrecognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be \\nsupportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;\\n\\n6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact \\nof the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of \\n2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.\\n\\nThe awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the\\nefforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first \\ngenocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new \\ngeneration has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically\\nmature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through\\nall necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the \\narmed struggle.

Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time\\nLIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind\\nthe tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?

When Big Government feels\\nit is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even\\nviolent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally\\nout of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war\\non its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,\\ngovernment of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the \\'lords\\' and other elites\\nwho want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn\\'t feel the\\nneed to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military\\nboot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced\\nthat it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances\\nredressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that\\nwill exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been\\nunresponsive or such acts wouldn\\'t be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse\\nto open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.\\nIts the old \\'might makes right\\' philosophy that is the hallmark of a\\ngovernment going rogue:  They don\\'t like it? Tough. We will simply\\nsquash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances\\nin other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too\\ninconvenient...

One would hear an explosion among many\\nexplosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000\\npound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,\\nand some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources\\nof buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as\\ngunfire, including 50\\'s tacking away, it would not stand out that much,\\nand could be explained by \"musta been a gas leak... \".

Opening\\nstatements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,\\neach side presenting its version of what happenned last August.\\n\\nThe prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to\\nIdaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the \"evil\" federal\\ngovernment.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal\\nagents \"sawed off\" shotguns and later failed to appear for\\ntrial: Despite repeated \"good faith\" efforts to get Weaver\\nto surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted\\nwhen Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and\\nbegan firing.  According to the prosecution, three people\\nwere taking an \"offensive action\" against an FBI helicopter\\nwhen an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.\\n\\nThe defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern\\nIdaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted\\nsimply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to\\nsell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution\\nalleged, want to become a \"regular supplier\").  The defense also\\nargued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when\\nhe wouldn\\'t become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,\\nbut I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist\\nangle of the story.  We\\'ll know more as things develop].  The\\nfailure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given\\nan incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.\\nThe shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed\\nWeaver\\'s dog that was in proximity to Weaver\\'s son, Samuel.  Weaver\\nthen fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal\\nagent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,\\nthere were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:\\nHowever, agents were near the body for an extended period of\\ntime and could have played with the select-fire - this will\\nhave to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims\\nthat Vicki Weaver was only going to \"look at the body\" [not recover?]\\nof her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.\\n\\nProsecution quote: \"Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made\\nthat confrontation.\" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist\\n\\nDefense quote: \"The evidence in this case is going to show that\\nthis is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged\\nwith crimes they didn\\'t commit in order to cover crimes that\\nthe government did commit.\"  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]\\n\\nNotes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters\\nheeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday\\'s protests\\noutside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate\\nagain had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including\\n\"Tim\" again.  \"Tim\" claimed he was a skinhead, who were \"ordinary,\\nworking class people.\"  He also claimed he was for \"white pride,\\nnot white power.\"\\n\\nOutside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview\\nwith Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly\\nwhat the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.\\n\\nIn an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about\\na dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the\\ncourthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence\\nin action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some\\ntidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent\\nwere volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they\\nbelieved in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,\\nrepeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the\\ndefendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the\\nrecounting of his wife\\'s death), and Spence compared the \"sawed\\noff\" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another\\ngood one!).\\n\\nToday (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to\\nbegin presenting evidence.\\n\\nDrew\\n=============================================================\\n\\n\\n-- \\n**************************************************************\\n* Ron Phillips               crphilli@hound.dazixca.ingr.com *\\n* Senior Customer Engineer                                   *\\n* Intergraph Electronics                                     *\\n* 381 East Evelyn Avenue               VOICE: (415) 691-6473 *\\n* Mountain View, CA 94041              FAX:   (415) 691-0350 *\\n**************************************************************\\n',\n",

It\\'s more likely that the Moon will never\\nbe the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no\\nmaterials we can\\'t get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids\\nand comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low\\ngrade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, \\nand it\\'s position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it\\'s heat \\nsink capacity could offer some military utility for \"high ground\" military\\nweapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space \\ntravel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as \\nMt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that\\'s a very minor \\nactivity in the global scope of things.\\n\\nLuna has an inconvienent gravity field. It\\'s likely too low to prevent\\ncalcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it\\'s\\ntoo high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories\\nthat can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna\\nhas a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital\\nsites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers\\na source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,\\nand shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and\\nheavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity\\nwells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.\\n\\nWe don\\'t use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually\\nignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That\\'s because we don\\'t have to\\ndeal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more\\nexpensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we\\'ll use the\\neasier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few\\ncenturies, if not much longer.\\n\\nLuna\\'s main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio\\nastronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth.

The first is\\nunlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.\\nThe second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good\\nenough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for\\nconventional warfare again.

Unlike the conventional large \\nVHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed \\nto individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier \\nfeeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast \\nbeam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the \\nantenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal \\ndivision/combination are performed at a low signal level using \\nelectronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna \\nbeam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the \\nzenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element \\nis crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful \\ncalibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna \\nelement was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for \\nthis purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to \\nmake a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern \\nmonitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific \\nsatellite OHZORA (EXOS-C).

During the Russian occupation of Erzurum, no Armenian\\n was permitted to approach the city and its environs.\\n\\n While the Commander of the First Army Corps, General Kaltiyin remained\\n in power, troops including Armenian enlisted men, were not sent to the\\n area. When the security measures were lifted, the Armenians began to \\n attack Erzurum and its surroundings. Following the attacks came the\\n plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder\\n of the owners of these houses...Plundering was widely committed by\\n the soldiers. This plunder was mainly committed by Armenian soldiers\\n who had remained in the rear during the war.\\n\\n One day, while passing through the streets on horseback, a group of\\n soldiers including an Armenian soldier began to drag two old men of\\n seventy years in a certain direction. The roads were covered with mud,\\n and these people were dragging the two helpless Turks through the mud\\n and dirt...\\n\\n It was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and\\n traps. The Turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds\\n and withdrew. The reason was that most of the Turks who were on night\\n patrol did not return, and no one knew what had happened to them. The \\n Turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear\\n also. Finally, the Court Martial which had been established for the\\n trials of murderers and plunderers, began to liquidate itself for\\n fear that they themselves would be punished. The incidents of murder\\n and rape, which had decreased, began to occur more frequently.\\n\\n Sometime in January and February, a leading Turkish citizen Haci Bekir\\n Efendi from Erzurum, was killed one night at his home. The Commander\\n in Chief (Odiselidge) gave orders to find murderers within three days.\\n The Commander in Chief has bitterly reminded the Armenian intellectuals\\n that disobedience among the Armenian enlisted men had reached its\\n highest point, that they had insulted and robbed the people and half\\n of the Turks sent outside the city had not returned.\\n\\n ...We learnt the details this incident from the Commander-in-Chief,\\n Odishelidge. They were as follows:\\n\\n The killings were organized by the doctors and the employers, and the\\n act of killing was committed solely by the Armenian renegades...\\n More than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless Turks have been\\n killed in Erzincan. Large holes were dug and the defenceless \\n Turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes. Later, the\\n murdered Turks were thrown into the holes. The Armenian who stood \\n near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses:\\n \\'Seventy dead bodies, well, this hole can take ten more.\\' Thus ten\\n more Turks would be cut into pieces, thrown into the hole, and when\\n the hole was full it would be covered over with soil.\\n\\n The Armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently\\n fill a house with eighty Turks, and cut their heads off one by one.\\n Following the Erzincan massacre, the Armenians began to withdraw\\n towards Erzurum... The Armenian renegades among those who withdrew\\n to Erzurum from Erzincan raided the Moslem villages on the road, and\\n destroyed the entire population, together with the villages.\\n\\n During the transportation of the cannons, ammunition and the carriages\\n that were outside the war area, certain people were hired among the \\n Kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages. While the travellers\\n were passing through Erzurum, the Armenians took advantage of the time\\n when the Russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill\\n the Kurds they had hired. When the Russian soldiers heard the cries\\n of the dying Kurds, they attempted to help them. However, the \\n Armenians threatened the Russian soldiers by vowing that they would\\n have the same fate if they intervened, and thus prevented them from\\n acting. All these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with\\n hatred and loathing.\\n\\n Lieutenant Medivani from the Russian Army described an incident that\\n he witnessed in Erzurum as follows: An Armenian had shot a Kurd. The\\n Kurd fell down but did not die. The Armenian attempted to force the\\n stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying Kurd. However, since\\n the Kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony, the Armenian failed\\n in his attempt. Having seen this, the Armenian ripped open the abdomen\\n of the Kurd, disembowelled him, and finally killed him by stamping\\n him with the iron heel of his boot.\\n\\n Odishelidge himself told us that all the Turks who could not escape\\n from the village of Ilica were killed. Their heads had been cut off\\n by axes. He also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered\\n children. Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov, who passed through the village\\n of Ilica, three weeks after the massacre told us the following:\\n\\n There were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces, on the roads.\\n Every Armenian who happened to pass through these roads, cursed and\\n spat on the corpses. In the courtyard of a mosque which was about\\n 25x30 meter square, dead bodies were piled to a height of 140 \\n centimeters. Among these corpses were men and women of every age,\\n children and old people. The women\\'s bodies had obvious marks of\\n rape. The genitals of many girls were filled with gun-powder.\\n\\n A few educated Armenian girls, who worked as telephone operators\\n for the Armenian troops were called by Lieutenant Colonel Gryaznov\\n to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be \\n proud of what the Armenians had done. To the lieutenant colonel\\'s\\n disgusted amazement, the Armenian girls started to laugh and giggle,\\n instead of being horrified. The lieutenant colonel had severely\\n reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour. When he told\\n the girls that the Armenians, including women, were generally more\\n licentious than even the wildest animals, and that their indecent\\n and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity\\n and barbarity, before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers,\\n the Armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and\\n claimed they had laughed because they were nervous.\\n\\n An Armenian contractor at the Alaca Communication zone command\\n narrated the following incident which took place on February 20:\\n\\n The Armenians had nailed a Turkish women to the wall. They had cut\\n out the women\\'s heart and placed the heart on top of her head.\\n The great massacre in Erzurum began on February 7... The enlisted men \\n of the artillery division caught and stripped 270 people. Then they\\n took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts. 100 people\\n among this group were able to save their lives as the result of\\n my decisive attempts. The others, the Armenians claimed, were \\n released when they learnt that I understood what was going on. \\n Among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the\\n Armenian officers, Karagodaviev. Today, some Turks were murdered\\n on the streets.\\n\\n On February 12, some Armenians have shot more than ten innocent\\n Moslems. The Russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were\\n threatened with death. Meanwhile I imprisoned an Armenian for\\n murdering an innocent Turk. \\n\\n When an Armenian officer told an Armenian murderer that he would \\n be hanged for his crime, the killer shouted furiously: \\'How dare\\n you hang an Armenian for killing a Turk?\\' In Erzurum, the \\n Armenians burned down the Turkish market. On February 17, I heard\\n that the entire population of Tepekoy village, situated within\\n the artillery area, had been totally annihilated. On the same \\n day when Antranik entered Erzurum, I reported the massacre to\\n him, and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible\\n act. However no result was achieved.\\n\\n In the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred, there was a\\n natural silence. On the night of 26/27 February, the Armenians deceived\\n the Russians, perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the \\n Turkish soldiers. Later, it was understood that this massacre had\\n been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular. \\n The population had been herded in a certain place and then killed\\n one by one. The number of murders committed on that night reached\\n three thousand. It was the Armenians who bragged to about the details\\n of the massacre. The Armenians fighting against the Turkish soldiers\\n were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even\\n withstand the Turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred\\n people and two cannons, for one night, and ran away. The leading\\n Armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre.\\n However, the Armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with\\n the renegades in this massacre, just as in all the others. The lower\\n classes within the Armenian community have always obeyed the orders\\n of the leading Armenian figures and commanders. \\n\\n I do not like to give the impression that all Armenian intellectuals\\n were accessories to these murders. No, for there were people who\\n opposed the Armenians for such actions, since they understood that\\n it would yield no result. However, such people were only a minority.\\n Furthermore, such people were considered as traitors to the Armenian\\n cause. Some have seemingly opposed the Armenian murders but have\\n supported the massacres secretly. Some, on the other hand, preferred\\n to remain silent. There were certain others, who, when accused by\\n the Russians of infamy, would say the following: \\'You are Russians.\\n You can never understand the Armenian cause.\\' The Armenians had a\\n conscience. They would commit massacres and then would flee in fear\\n of the Turkish soldiers.\"\\n\\n\\nSerdar Argic\\n\\n                           \\'We closed the roads and mountain passes that \\n                            might serve as ways of escape for the Turks \\n                            and then proceeded in the work of extermination.\\'\\n                                                  (Ohanus Appressian - 1919)\\n                           \\'In Soviet Armenia today there no longer exists \\n                            a single Turkish soul.\\' (Sahak Melkonian - 1920)\\n\\n\\n',\n",

So far, Israe \\ncontinues to propose that they remain. The Palestinians propose that they \\nleave. Why should either change their view? It is worth pointing out that \\nthe only area of compromise accomodating both views seems to require a\\nreduction in the Israeli presence. Israel proposes no such reduction....\\nand in fact may be said to *not* be negotiating.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nTim: \\n\\nThere seem to be two perceptions that **have to be addressed**. The\\nfirst is that of Israel, where there is little trust for Arab groups, so\\nthere is little support for Israel giving up **tangible** assets in \\nexchange for pieces of paper, \"expectations\", \"hopes\", etc. The second\\nis that of the Arab world/Palestinians, where there is the demand that\\nthese \"tangible concessions\" be made by Israel **without** it receiving\\nanything **tangible** back.  Given this, the gap between the two stances\\nseems to be the need by Israel of receiving some ***tangible*** returns\\nfor its expected concessions. By \"tangible\" is meant something that\\n1) provides Israel with \"comparable\" protection (from the land it is to \\ngive up), 2) in some way ensures that the Arab states and Palestine \\n**will be** accountable and held actively (not just \"diplomatically) \\nresponsible for the upholding of all actions on its territory (by citizens \\nor \"visitors\").\\n\\nIn essence I do not believe that Israel objections to Palestinian\\nstatehood would be anywhere near as strong as they are now IF Israel\\nwas assured that any new Palestinian state *would be committed to** \\nco-existing with Israel and held responsible for ALL attacks on Israel \\nfrom its territory.\\n\\tAside from some of the rather slanted proposals above,\\n\\thow *could* such \"guarantees\" be instilled? For example,\\n\\thow could such \"guarantees\"/\"controls\" be added to the\\n\\tPalestinian PISGA proposals?\\n\\nIsrael is hanging on largely because it is scared stiff that the minute\\nit lets go (gives lands back to Arab states, no more \"buffer zone\", gives\\nfull autonomy to Palestinians), ANY and/or ALL of the Arab parties\\ncould (and *would*, if not \"controlled\" somehow) EASILY return to the \\ntraditional anti-Israel position.

But the \\nreligious leaders need to make a living through religion?

Is that why  God has put his house in there? \\n\\nI think this religious stuff has gone too far.

I\\nlistened in on part of O\\'Connor\\'s briefing to the press\\non Monday, and in one part of the briefing O\\'Connor\\ntalked about how the White House wants three options,\\nsorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part\\nof the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has\\nformed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,\\nmodular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch\\nCore [\"wingless Orbiter\"] @ JSC. Later, in response to\\na reporters question, I thought I heard O\\'Connor say\\nthe option based on a SSF redesign was a \"moderate\"\\ncost option, in between low & high cost options. Not\\nthe \"high cost\" option as Sawyer wrote).\\n\\nThe article goes on to describe the other two options\\nas \"one features modules that could gradually be fitted\\ntogether in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The\\nother is a core facility that could be deposited in\\norbit in a single launch, like Skylab.

Jews who left Arab states are fully \\nentitled to make claims and should do so, if they consider their case has\\na merit. It is their basic right to return to these countries, if they\\nwish. If not, they should not complain and compare themselves to the\\nPalestinians who have been struggling for the right of return since\\nIsrael was established and whose right is upheld by the United Nations\\nquasi totally. If Jews feel discriminated in Arab countries, they have a\\nlegitimate claim that any decent person can and should support. \\n\\nHuman rights violations by Arab States don't justify, legitimate nor\\nare the cause for Israeli breaches of international law and human rioghts.\\nIsraeli breaches stem from the Zionist concept, which can only be\\nimplemented by negating basic rights to Palestinians. \\n\\nIsraeli trights and Palestinian rights are not symmetrical. The first\\nparty has a state and the other has none. The first is an occupier and\\nthe second the occupied. For any meaningful relationship to emerge, some\\nsymmetry must be established.

As outsiders, it\\'s fine for \\nus to say, \"He should hire a different coach.\"  In fact, he has talked about\\ndoing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so\\nbuilt up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of\\nthe playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to \\nprove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second\\nround.  He needs to, as the papers say, \"get that monkey off his back.\"\\nSo it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish\\nto let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we\\'re all\\na little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he\\'ll step down\\nfrom behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will\\nimprove as a result.\\n\\nI think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent\\non GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we\\'ll see how\\ngood of a GM he really is.\\n\\n>But Murray is an average (unspectacular) NHL coach and a pretty good GM\\n>so none of this is true anyway.\\n\\nI may not agree with everything you\\'ve said, but it\\'s been fun discussing\\nit with you.\\n\\n>Gregmeister\\n\\n--Randy\\n\\n',\n",

Can\\'t believe people actually put\\n>win as first in a tie breaker......\\n\\nGolly, I love stupid people. :-)\\nListen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,\\nthere exist these things called \"ties\".  A tie occurs when a game ends\\nwith the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. \\nThere also exits these things called \"wins\".  A win is when one team has a\\nhigher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other\\nat a time, so I can say \"the opponent\".)  A team gets two points for a\\nwin.  So, let\\'s say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10\\nties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The\\nfirst team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86\\npoints.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number\\nof wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That\\'s amazing.  So,\\nRex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then\\nthat\\'s what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the\\ntiebreaker and therefore have the \"better\" record, even though both teams\\nhad the same number of points.  If you didn\\'t understand this post, Rex,\\nmaybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.\\n:-) :-) :-) :-) :-) :-)\\n\\n--\\n    Keith Keller\\t\\t\\t\\tLET\\'S GO RANGERS!!!!!\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLET\\'S GO QUAKERS!!!!!\\n\\tkkeller@mail.sas.upenn.edu\\t\\tIVY LEAGUE CHAMPS!!!!\\n\\n            \"When I want your opinion, I\\'ll give it to you.\" \\n',\n",

If this were\\nso, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide\\nwould be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in\\ncities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show\\na higher fatality rate.  But the Nat\\'l Commission on the Causes and\\nPrevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this\\nnot to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife\\nattacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks\\n(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),\\nthe proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the\\nproportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.\\n\\nWhat was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on\\nthe part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended\\nto show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave\\nphysical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the\\nhead neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this\\npattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of\\nrage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.\\n\\n\\tSource: Report on Firearms and Violence\\n\\n: Then, since England != USA (my ancestors left because of the oppression) you  \\n: must compare England before strict gun laws to England after strict gun laws to  \\n: be able to draw any meaning at all.  England has essentially legalized drugs,  \\n: so there are no drug gangs battling for turf, etc., there.  If you drop out the  \\n: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.\\n\\nThere are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I\\'m not\\nfond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and\\nAmericans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic\\ndifferences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found\\nmyself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I\\ndon\\'t think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent\\ncrime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every\\nlaw-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.\\n\\nOn the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more\\nculturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,\\nseven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates\\nof Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities\\nwith roughly the same population, urban economy, geography\\nand crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.\\n\\nIn Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After\\na 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed\\nweapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.\\n\\nIn Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason\\nto purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.\\nRecreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are\\nregulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a\\nrestricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in\\norder to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns\\ntransported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.\\nIn short, gun control but not unreasonably so.\\n\\nBoth cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for\\ngun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers\\nstudied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),\\nburglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from\\n1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same\\nstandard: the FBI\\'s Unified Crime Report.\\n\\nResults: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver\\n(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).\\n18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in\\nVancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in\\nSeattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /\\n1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher\\n(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by\\nweapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.\\nAlthough both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated\\nassault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were\\nfar more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.\\n\\nOver the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle\\n(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).\\nAfter adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,\\nthe relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as\\ncompared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.\\n\\nWhen homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate\\nof homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in\\nSeattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.\\nVirtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to\\na more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns\\naccounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns\\nwere 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than\\nin Vancouver.\\n\\nThe authors of the report also investigated \"legally justifiable\"\\nhomicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during\\nthe seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only\\n21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in\\nSeattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After\\nexcluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these\\nearlier findings.\\n\\n-------\\n\\nThis is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the\\nargument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because\\nVancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times\\nthat of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports\\nannual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,\\nChicago, Los Angeles and Houston.\\n\\nCritics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access\\nto handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because\\npersons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a\\ngun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.\\nIf the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by\\nthe strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we\\ncould expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to\\nbe higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study\\ninterval, Vancouver\\'s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns\\nwas not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that\\nfew would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.\\n\\nAs well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding\\ncitizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did\\nexperience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these\\ncases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities\\nduring the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,\\nSeattle apparently didn\\'t enjoy relief from any crime category\\nover Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for\\nself-defense.\\n\\n\\tHeavily quoted source: Handgun Regulation, Crime,\\n\\tAssaults, and Homicide: A Tale of Two Cities.\\n\\n\\tJohn H.

There many people alive today who were born in \\n>a city called Konstantinoupolis. \\n\\nI know it doesn't make sense, but since when is 'Napoleon' about\\nsense, anyway? Further striking bigoted and racist attitude of \\ncertain Greeks still exists in our day. Most Greeks insist even \\ntoday, that the 537 year-old capital of the Ottoman Empire should \\nbe called not by its rightful name of Istanbul, but by its half \\na millennium-old moniker 'Cons*(whatever).'\\n\\nEveryone knows that New York City was once called 'New Amsterdam'\\nbut Dutch people do not persist on calling it that today. The name \\nof Stalingrad too is long gone, replaced by Volgagrad. China's\\nPeking traded its name for Beiging long ago. Ciudad Trujillo\\nof the Dominican Republic is now Santa Domingo. Zimbabve's\\nold colonial capital Salisburry became Harrare. These changes\\nhave all been accepted officially by everyone in the world.\\n\\nBut, Greeks are still determined on calling the Turkish Istanbul \\nby the name of 'Cons*.'\\n\\nHow can one explain this total intransigence? What makes Greeks\\nso different from other mortals? 18-year-old questionable\\ndemocracy? Why don't they seem to reconcile with the fact,\\nfor instance, that Istanbul changed hands 537 years ago in\\n1453 AD, and that this predates the discovery of the New \\nWorld, by 39 years. The declaration of U.S. independence\\nin 1776 will come 284 years later.\\n\\nShouldn't then, half a millennium be considered enough time for \\n'Cons*' to be called a Turkish city? Where is the logic in the \\nGreek reasoning, if there is any? How long can one sit on the \\nlaurels of an ancient civilization? Ancient Greece does not exist, \\nany more than any other 16 civilizations that existed on the soil \\nof Anatolia.\\n\\nThese undereducated 'wieneramus' live with an illusion. It \\nis the same mentality which allows them to rationalize\\nthat Cyprus is a Greek Island. No history book shows\\nthat it ever was. It belonged to the Ottoman Turks 'lock,\\nstock and barrel' for a period of well over 300 years.\\n\\nIn fact, prior to the Turks' acquisition of it, following\\nbloody naval battles with the Venetians in 1570 AD, the\\nisland of Cyprus belonged, invariably, to several nations:\\n\\nThe Assyrians, the Sumerians, the Phoenicians, the Egyptians,\\nthe Ottoman Turks, of course in that order, owned it as \\ntheir territory. But, it has never been the possession\\nof the government of Greece - not even for one day -\\nin the history of the world. Moreover, Cyprus is\\nlocated 1500 miles from the Greek mainland, but only \\n40 miles from Turkiye's southern coastline.\\n\\nSaddam Hussein claims that Kuwait was once Iraqi\\nterritory and the Greek Cypriot government and \\nthe terrorist Greek governments think that Cyprus\\nalso was once part of the Greek hegemony.\\n\\nThose 'Arromdians' involved in this grandiose hallucination\\nshould wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront \\nreality. Again, wishful thinking is unproductive, only \\nfacts count.\\n\\nAs for Selanik,\\n\\n  <<Those Jews who survived these assaults in Southeastern Europe fled\\n  particularly to Salonica, whose Jewish population increased substantially\\n  as a result, from 28,000 in 1876 to 90,000 in 1908, more than half the\\n  total population, though even there increased persecution by local Greeks\\n  led many Jews to flee elsewhere in the Ottoman Empire, particularly to\\n  the great port of Izmir.\\n\\n  Despite all the pressure from Ottomans and foreign Jews alike, the ritual\\n  murders and other assaults by Christians on Jews went on and on. Greek\\n  efforts to decimate the Jewish population of Salonica culminated in 1912\\n  and 1913, following Greek conquest of Salonica during the first Balkan War,\\n  when many of its Jews, were either killed or terrorized into leaving...>>\\n\\n  <<Though Greece was obligated by the post World War I treaties to allow\\n  Jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to\\n  practice their religions without hindrance, a law was issued in 1923\\n  which forbad all inhabitants from working on Sunday, stimulating a new\\n  Jewish exodus as it was intended to do. Between 1932 and 1934 there was a\\n  series of anti-Semitic riots in Salonica, with the Cambel quarter, where\\n  most of the remaining Jews lived, being burned to the ground. This\\n  was followed by regulations requiring the use of Greek and prohibiting\\n  Hebrew and Judea-Spanish in the Jewish schools. A start was made also\\n  on expropriating the land of the principal Jewish cemetery in Salonica\\n  for use by the new University in order to derive the Jews out [47]. By\\n  killing and driving out large numbers of Jews, the Greeks left a\\n  substantial Greek majority in the city for the first time, and starting\\n  Salonica Jewry on the way to its final decimation by the Nazis during the\\n  occupation of Greece starting in 1941.\\n\\n  Salonica and Izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for\\n  Jewish refugees entering the Empire during its last century of existence.\\n  Istanbul, Edirne, and other parts of Rumelia and Anatolia received\\n  thousands more. Nor were Jews the only refugees received and helped by\\n  the government of the Sultan. Thousands of Muslims accompanied them in\\n  flight from similar persecutions wherever Balkan christian states gained\\n  independence or expanded. The Russian conquest of the Crimea and the\\n  Caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century, and particularly during\\n  and after the Crimean War, combined with the same independence movements\\n  in Southeastern Europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among\\n  its Jews caused thousands of helpless, ill, and poverty-stricken Muslim\\n  refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the\\n  Ottoman Empire, with the Istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly\\n  to house and feed them as best it could. From 1850 to 1864 as many as\\n  800,000 Crimean Tatars, Circassians, and other Muslims from north and\\n  east of the Black Sea had entered Anatolia alone, as many as 200,000 more\\n  came during the next twenty years, while 474,389 refugees entered in 1876-\\n  1877 as a result of the Ottoman wars with Russia and the Balkan states,\\n  with an equal number gaining refuge in the European portions of the\\n  Empire.>>\\n\\n[47] Robert Mantran, 'La structure sociale de la communaute juive de\\n  Salonqiue a la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle', RH no.534 (1980), 391-92;\\n  Nehama VII, 762; Joseph Nehama (Salonica) to AIU (Paris) no.2868/2,\\n  12 May 1903 (AIU Archives I-C-43); and no.2775, 10 January 1900 (AIU\\n  Archives I-C-41), describing daily battles between Jewish and Greek\\n  children in the streets of Salonica.

If you\\'re\\npaying attention, I\\'ve mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own\\neyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps\\npeople judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,\\n\"bullshit filters\".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.\\n\\n  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here\\'s the entire post:\\n  --------------------------------------------------\\n>We haven\\'t used tanks against the black ghettos since Detroit 1948. \\n\\nCorrection.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it\\nwas well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions\\nit in his song \"Black Day in July\".\\n  --------------------------------------------------\\n\\n  Since you don\\'t dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that\\nmeans I was right.  \\n\\n: I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the \\'67\\n: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place\\n: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American\\n: military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have\\n: been *big* news.\\n\\n   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  \\n\\nAwesley goes on:\\n  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.\\n\\n: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion\\n: grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be\\n: perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn\\'t you, since\\n: it makes your other claim seem more plausible.\\n\\nJohn, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you\\'re losing it so you\\nhave to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said\\nnothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you\\nneed some help, let me know and I\\'l take your side of this for a\\nwhile.  You\\'re not scoring here, you\\'re boring here. \\n\\n: If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been\\n: screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about\\n: it. \\n\\n   Glad to know you\\'re such an expert.  Nice to hear some an\\nauthority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it\\nhad happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an\\nauthority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged\\nmassive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.\\nSome claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but\\nthe Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was \"several\".  I\\'ve also\\nheard some things about that but I won\\'t dare repeat them.  You\\'d\\nassert that I claimed they were truth.\\n\\n: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. \\n\\n   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the \\ndifference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 \\nyears ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.\\nSo it would have been an Army cover-up.\\n\\n   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building\\nwere burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and\\nam inclined to believe an old sarge or two.\\n\\n: If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer\\n: to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that\\n: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.\\n\\n   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I\\'m quite willing to believe\\nthat they did fire their guns.\\n\\n   Now then, we\\'ve bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read\\nthis far and all you\\'ve managed to say is that you don\\'t believe the\\naccount I cited.\\n\\n: --John L.

What, you may ask, does gas guns\\nhave to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically\\nlocated across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,\\nand the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)\\nfrom which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the\\noffice he works for is an administrative convenience.\\n\\nI visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.\\nAt the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,\\nbut I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),\\n\\nThe gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber\\nabout 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).\\nThe chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several\\nhundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston\\nis hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens\\nof atmospheres.\\n\\nThe piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until\\na stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.\\nThe barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch\\nbore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they\\nintersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel\\ncould be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to\\nmove the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used\\nin testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\nand about 50 cm long.\\n\\nAll of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen\\ngas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the\\nbarrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a\\nsheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The\\nplastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped\\nin the barrel ahead of the projectile.  \\n\\nThe gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic\\nwater jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic\\nprojectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,\\nthe projectile vaporizes.\\n\\nThe testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is\\nabout 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km\\nif fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun\\nto Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can\\nfire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB\\nto follow the projectiles.\\n\\nThe design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4\\nkm/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,\\nand the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test\\nthey blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it\\nhad to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but\\nI haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).\\n\\nThere are people waiting to test scramjet components in this\\ngun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=\\n4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.\\n\\nThis gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically\\na proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-\\nsized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of\\n100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg\\nuseful payload to orbit.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\\n-- \\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\\n\",\n",

Tavares)\\nSubject: Re: [long]: Gun Hearings Day in Massachusetts (April 7)\\nOrganization: Stratus Computer, Inc.\\nLines: 263\\nDistribution: usa\\nNNTP-Posting-Host: rocket.sw.stratus.com\\n\\n[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]\\n\\nGun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day\\nwith a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.\\nIt was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,\\nwhereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from\\nwherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.\\n\\nMike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to\\nremind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been\\nchecked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the\\npeople in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of\\n\"election fraud\" to hold their jobs.\\n\\nNancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and\\nsheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and\\ntelling people where to find their own representatives (and in too\\nmany cases, who they were).\\n\\nMike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and\\ndiscuss a bill that hadn\\'t made it onto the official list.  It seems a\\ndelegation of students from Simon\\'s Rock of Bard College (alma mater\\nof Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was\\nbeing bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or\\nammo to anyone who is not a state resident.\\n\\nThe hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner\\nAuditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor\\'s\\nhearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive\\nhusbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole\\nour representatives, after which we would be squashed into an\\ninadequate hearing room.\\n\\nOne of my representatives\\' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.\\nHe said, \"Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is\\nalways so organized every year.\"  I got a little pissed, and replied,\\n\"I\\'m not from the gun lobby -- I\\'m from your district.\"\\n\\nAt 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a\\ndemonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the\\npro-gunners weren\\'t).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his\\nmirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and\\nseveral Simon\\'s Rock anti-gun \"close-the-loophole\" protestors.\\n(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)\\n\\nThe room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were\\nabout 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers\\nfrom Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got\\ncloser than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A\\ncop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the\\ncrowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker\\nwas set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.\\n\\nEveryone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet\\nsaying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up\\nto \"support GOAL\\'s position\" on \"all bills.\"\\n\\nFirst, because of their time constraints, public officials got to\\ntestify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students\\nhad some curfew, I guess).  \\n\\nCurrently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long\\nguns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of\\nhis own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to\\nnon-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon\\'s Rock\\nfolks called the current law a \"loophole\" and wanted it closed.\\n\\nTwo of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his \"SKS assault rifle.\"\\nThe second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well\\nthat he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo\\'s home state) with Missouri,\\nand became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery\\ncorrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed\\nthat the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was\\nlying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining\\nstates ONLY if they have licensing in their own state \"as strong as\"\\nthat in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that\\'s that.\\n\\nSome of the things these two said were really offensive.  \"In some of\\nthese other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he\\'s breathing!\"\\n(Oooooo!)  \"We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if\\nonly the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn\\'t\\nbe having this situation -- but they won\\'t.\"  (Naughty, naughty!)\\n\\nNext up was Boston city councilman Albert \"Dapper\" O\\'Neill.  He was\\nthere to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He\\'s\\nreasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he\\'s\\nalmost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the\\nACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were\\njudge, he\\'d give arrestees their \"last rights\" (pun intended) on the\\nspot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)\\nHe said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the\\nright direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(\\n\\nTwo of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a\\nCCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a\\nrestraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining\\norder requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction\\n-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor\\nof it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,\\n\"I\\'m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to\\nget these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have\\nconvicted.\"  I haven\\'t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous\\nperformance since Nixon whined that he wasn\\'t a crook.\\n\\nBarrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable\\nevery five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated\\npurpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.\\n\"Revenue has nothing to do with it.\"  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some\\ncongressmen think we\\'re stupid enough to swallow the argument that\\nit\\'s preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the\\nvague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn\\ncard away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the\\nlaw-abiding instead of the crook.\\n\\nThe two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.\\nJujuga didn\\'t say much (he was a co-sponsor of both \"restraining\\norder\" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn\\'t let any\\nbad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He \\nwas a co-sponsor of one of the \"restraining order\" bills as well.)  One\\nof the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was\\nvociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in\\nthe right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, \"every\\nyear it\\'s the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...\"\\nIt\\'s nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been\\nmore effective.\\n\\nAt about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn\\'t continue.\\nSomeone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because\\nthe loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was\\ndisconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had\\nto leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the \"public\"\\ntestimony; the other got a seat this time.\\n\\nCaron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the\\nstate, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.\\nHe complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that\\nhis PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great\\nquote: \"If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state\\ncomputer system until 1999.\"  (This was also an argument he used\\nagainst the renewable FID card.)\\n\\nTestimony was heard from several \"battered women,\" one of whom had\\nbeen attacked by some guy in his 20\\'s who had an FID card because he\\ngot it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and\\nsaid how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General\\nHarshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how\\n50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women\\nneeded to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was\\ngranted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether\\nthe order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be\\nsatisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather\\nthan after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long\\nrambling circumlocution in response.\\n\\nThen testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks\\nsomething like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining\\norders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue\\nrestraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they\\nthink is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining\\norders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.\\nAtty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.\\n\\nOther pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a\\nrestraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she\\ncountered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have\\nallowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.\\nOne of the junior reps noted that \"this is America\" and we have to be\\ncertain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga\\nreiterated this, saying that \"people who abuse smaller people can go\\nto Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating\\nconviction with a restraining order.\"  (Point and match, Senator.)\\n\\nAnother pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn\\'t know his\\ncitizenship \"expired every 5 years,\" and that a driver\\'s license was a\\nprivilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.\\n\\nA third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice\\nsystem, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public\\nhangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death\\npenalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public\\nhangings.  The speaker then responded, \"I\\'ll make you a deal.  You get\\nme the rope, and I\\'ll tie the noose.\"\\n\\nNext came public testimony on the Simon\\'s Rock bill.  A teacher\\ntestified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that \"he\\nwouldn\\'t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was\\noutside\" without his evil gun.  She said that the \"loophole\" should be\\nclosed to prevent something like this from \"ever happening again\".\\n\\nFour or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of\\nspilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually\\nshot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,\\nsaying, \"As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are\\nsafe -- support gun control.\"  The committee was reluctant to grill or\\ncorrect the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had\\nclaimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  \"Only residents can get\\nFID\\'s,\" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no\\nidea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut\\nout-of-staters completely off?)\\n\\nYacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as\\nwritten would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by\\nout-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could\\nbe put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary\\nsomewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino\\nunderscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident\\nstudent -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental\\nrecord.\\n\\nOne junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy\\na gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was \"elitist\".  Another\\n(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents\\nfrom buying without an FID because only two other states in the union\\nhad \"FID-type\" cards, so complying with all the laws of one\\'s home\\nstate was \"not enough.\"  One pro-gun speaker replied that this\\nresembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,\\n\"Everyone\\'s out of step but Johnny!\"\\n\\nAll the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony\\nfor this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the\\nother bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and\\nGOAL\\'s position) were:\\n\\no  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull \\n   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)\\n\\no  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)\\n\\no  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly\\n   opposed)\\n\\no  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws \\n   (opposed)\\n\\no  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)\\n\\no  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)\\n\\no  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)\\n\\no  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)\\n\\no  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)\\n\\nSome of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining\\npro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.\\n\\nMike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger\\nlock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee\\nto carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.\\n\\nCaron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.\\nAgain, he brought up the state\\'s archaic records capability and said,\\n\"This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.\"\\n\\nThe session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it\\ncould not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It\\nended at about 6:30.\\n-- \\n\\ncdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company,\\nOR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors\\' Packet...\\n\\n',\n",

This is the marketing strategy - selling the\\ngame by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the\\nNBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is \\nbringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are\\ntrying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect \\nexamples of players that real fans know aren\\'t worth a damn and yet, being\\nbenificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals\\nthat would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to\\nattract, that these players are indeed superstars.\\n\\n>>They made the transaction to try and build a winner around Mario, that is \\n>>true.  But the improvement in attendance came before they started doing\\n>>this (Coffey late in 1987) and before they even had a playoff bound team.\\n>>A doubling of attendance occured in 1984-85 from the previous year.  An\\n>>increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival\\n>>of Mario Lemieux is what did it. \\n\\n>It might help to think about what would go through a fan\\'s mind who suddenly\\n>found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\n>amazing, I\\'ll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we\\'ve got a *kick*\\n>*ass* guy on *our* side, I\\'ll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\\n\\nIt ain\\'t nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn\\'t think about much \\nat all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that\\nMcDonalds makes good hamburgers?\\n \\n>I did provide the example of Rocket Ismail and the Toronto Argonauts of the \\n>CFL...did you leave it out because you don\\'t know much about the CFL?

Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring\\na ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring\\nahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.\\n\\nEklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42\\npoints in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor\\nin the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in\\nhis career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as\\na disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.\\n\\nMy choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players,\\nbut I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest\\ndisappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect\\ncoach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO\\nhas cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any\\ncoach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a\\nbright idea needs to go back to coaching school.\\n\\npete clark jr - rsh FLYERS contact and mailing list owner\\n\",\n",

Remember from stellar evolution that \\nblack holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,\\nM(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking\\nappoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,\\nthey don\\'t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any\\nof these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB\\'s) will be in the plane of the\\ngalaxy.  \\n        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the\\nvarious satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either\\nPion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our\\ncatalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic\\ndistribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of\\nhomogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are\\nsampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.\\nNot cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I\\nsuppose you are saying, \"Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the\\ndisk.\"  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an\\ninterplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out\\nto beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de\\ntect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here\\'s an \\nanalogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from\\nthe origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile\\naway sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his\\narbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,\\nand you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe\\nfind a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  \\n        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don\\'t work, also.  As I\\nsaid before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short\\ntimescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of\\nbehavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound\\nto the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.\\nWhen you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,\\nbut you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see\\nnot only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources \\nin the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of\\nthese characteristics.  \\n        \\n        I think that\\'s all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows\\nsomething that I don\\'t know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor of\\ntaking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these\\ndifferent distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible\\ndistribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars,\\nblack holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It\\'s a fun\\nfield. \\n        Complaints and corrections to: belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu or \\npost here.  \\n                                                        -jeremy\\n\\n        \\n',\n",

In fact, JPL is actively\\ninvolved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three\\nimportant ways,\" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on\\nthe balloon research campaign.  \\n\\n     \"There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,\" he\\ncontinued.  \"The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,\\nand the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth\\nfor those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own\\nright.\"\\n\\n     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more\\npieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the\\nmid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. \\nUnderstanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps\\nscientists construct more accurate computer models which are\\ninstrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.\\n\\n     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL\\ninstruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures\\nozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;\\na submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave\\nradiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier\\ntransform infrared interferometer which monitors how the\\natmosphere absorbs sunlight. \\n\\n     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-\\nhour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130\\nkilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground\\nstations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.\\nPacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded\\nto separate from the balloon.\\n\\n     \"We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared\\nmeasurements,\" Margitan explained, \"and we also needed to fly in\\ndarkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.\"\\n\\n     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the\\ncompleted results of their experiments.  They will then forward\\ntheir data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space\\nFlight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS\\nscientists.    \\n\\n     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon\\nFacility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a\\ncontract from NASA\\'s Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was\\nlaunched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction\\nand the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.\\n\\n     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than\\none-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic\\nmeters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with\\nhelium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh\\nbetween 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).

EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It\\'s\\nan honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the\\nwinner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the\\nRose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell\\nthat this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win\\na national championship.  And we\\'re glad to have them here.\\n\\n     I\\'m inspired not only by how the team pulled together to\\nwin the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to\\ncheer them onto victory.\\n\\n     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in\\nsize, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can\\nunderstand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.\\nIn our state people are still talking about the time we won the\\nOrange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was\\nback in 1978.  I\\'m sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine\\nwill as proud of this team as they are today.\\n\\n     You know, in my state football is a slightly more\\npopular sport than hockey.  We don\\'t have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)\\nBut after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I\\ncan understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came\\nhere.  Hockey is a tough game.  It\\'s a hard-hitting sport.  It does\\nhave one virtue though, there\\'s a penalty for delay of game.  I wish\\nwe had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)\\n\\n     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In\\nthe United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority\\nLeader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior\\nSenator -- Cohen looks so young, I can\\'t imagine.  (Laughter.)  I\\'m\\nactually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger\\nthan me.\\n\\n     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done\\na great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship\\ngame, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I\\nknow a little bit about.\\n\\n     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams\\nand in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and\\nSenator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine\\nmust feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a\\nteam, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from\\nbehind.\\n\\n     I think it\\'s important, as I ask young people from\\naround America who have achieved outstanding things in working\\ntogether, to come here to the White House to be recognized and\\nappreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values\\nand those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all\\nof our lives.\\n\\n     We now have another role model, and I\\'m glad to have\\nthem here today.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     (The President is presented with team jersey.)\\n(Applause.)\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That\\'s great.  I love it.  It\\'s beautiful.\\n(Applause.)\\n\\n     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That\\'s great.  (Applause.)\\n\\n                             * * * * * *\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco\\nthis morning, sir?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney\\nGeneral made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions\\nto her and to the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it\\nshould be executed?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.\\nThat was their judgment, the FBI.\\n\\n     Q  Is this a raid?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --\\ntalk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be\\ndone, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical\\ndecisions.\\n\\n     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this\\nmorning?\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my\\nquarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).\\n\\n     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator\\nMitchell, he\\'s worth a quarter any day.\\n\\n     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen\\nthis week in the Senate and about what other meetings we\\'re going to\\nhave for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to\\ntalk.  And we agreed we\\'d get back together later, around noon, and\\ntalk some more.\\n\\n     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your\\ncompromise is no compromise.\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator\\nDole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for\\nthe same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research\\nindicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28\\nemergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan\\nand Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those\\npurposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people\\nback to work.  I don\\'t want to go back and revisit every one, but you\\n\\n\\ncan do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position\\nthey\\'re taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year\\ndeficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time\\nand then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got\\nto be paid for don\\'t have much of a history on which to base their\\nposition.  They\\'ve got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this\\nkind that had very little to with putting the American people back to\\nwork.  So I think we\\'ve got a chance to work it out, and I\\'m hopeful.\\nWe\\'ll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I\\'m feeling pretty good\\nabout it.\\n\\n     THE PRESS:  Thank you\\n\\n                                 END       10:10 A.M.

Even the inhabitants of the village do not \\nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \\nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you\\'re gonna hurt our soldiers\\nyou\\'re gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \\nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\\nIsrael\\'s retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \\nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \\nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \\nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \\nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \\nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\\n\\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\\nwould have resulted in.  \\nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \\nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel\\'s \\npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \\nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \\npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \\naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \\ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\\n  \\n|> If you ask me those questions, I will have no problem answering (not with a \\n|> question, as you did) : No, NOBODY is qualified candidate for murder, nothing\\n|> justifies murder.\\n\\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\\n\\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\\n|> similar statements, maybe after eliminating all Israelis, jews, ? Am I wrong ?\\n\\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \\noccupying soldier is attacked.\\n \\n\\n|> Dorin\\n\\nBasil\\n',\n",

The\\nfirst is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not\\nhave gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance\\nbecause this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was\\nvery dangerous to the children and they could not have survived\\nwithout gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't\\nthose people have a right to practice their religion?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their\\nreligion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had\\nviolated federal laws, any number of them.\\n\\n     Q  What federal laws --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't\\nanswer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the\\nwhole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they\\nwere convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but\\nit would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of\\nthe things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of\\nthis because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were\\nspeculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that\\nthe windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have\\nescaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.\\n\\n     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground\\ncompound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be\\nsent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if\\nthe children were not released immediately outside that the humane\\nthing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace\\nwhere they could be protected.\\n\\n     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned\\nyesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas\\nwas supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks\\nthemselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they\\nall had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a\\nnonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.\\n\\n     MS. MYERS:  Last question.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --\\n\\n     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked\\nJanet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you\\nlearned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your\\nmind during those horrendous moments?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had\\nconsidered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --\\nand, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the\\npublic -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that\\nthe people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues\\nconcluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would\\nbe tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in\\nthe future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were\\nright or wrong, of course, we will never know.\\n\\n     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the\\nbuilding burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate\\nconcern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were\\nescaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.\\nThat's the first thing I wanted to know.\\n\\n     Thank you.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a\\nJanet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't\\nhave a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't\\ngo over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I\\ntake responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I\\nsigned off on the general decision and giving her the authority to\\nmake the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had\\nelapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,\\nif you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.\\nAnd I do support her.\\n\\n     She is not ultimately responsible to the American\\npeople; I am.

Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)\\n\\torients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a\\n\\tnegative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other\\n\\tadvantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort\\n\\tmaneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of\\n\\tthe horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining\\n\\tdownrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target\\n\\tin second stage.\"\\n\\n    This really is a good answer, but it\\'s couched in NASA jargon. I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.\\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly\\n\\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThis causes a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and this force \"alleviates structural loading.\"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wings -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more\\n\\tmass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated\\n\\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort\\n\\tmaneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (\"decreased abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improved S-band look angles\").\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is\\n\\tmore nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its\\n\\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    This all begs the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad oriented to give\\n    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer is that the pads were leftovers\\n    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is\\n    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented\\n    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'s.  (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\'s also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.\\tHe added that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons\\n    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping\\n    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total\\n    maneuver is really expressed as a \"quaternion,\" a grad-level-math\\n    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element\\n    array.\\n\\n\\n    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT\\n\\n    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite\\n    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72\\n    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed\\n    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from\\n    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.\\n    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite\\n    for these viewers.\\n\\n    If you can\\'t get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.\\n    It\\'s worth asking if yours doesn\\'t.\\n\\n    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is\\n    frequently posted to sci.space.news.

Bussard, Journal of\\n\\tPropulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990\\n\\n\\t    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion\\n\\t    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the\\n\\t    thrust-power \"gain\" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values\\n\\t    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are\\n\\t    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, \"high-thrust\"\\n\\t    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system\\n\\t    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local\\n\\t    gravitational acceleration.

Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion\\n\\tEnergy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.\\n\\n\\t    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron\\n\\t    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times\\n\\t    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma\\n\\t    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds\\n\\t    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities\\n\\t    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and\\n\\t    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm\\n\\t    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure\\n\\t    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically\\n\\t    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power\\n\\t    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens\\n\\t    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the\\n\\t    multi-gigawatt electric output size.

Good thing, because the Blues quit\\nplaying.\\n\\nThey held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared\\nwith 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep\\nand barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.\\nTampa\\'s Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating\\nsupervisor John D\\'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the\\nshot had gone into the net after time had expired.\\n\\n``I\\'m glad I didn\\'t see it go in at the end,\" Blues coach Bob Berry said.\\n\\nIf the goal had counted, he\\'d have been more upset than he was by the Blues\\'\\ndisappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making\\nthe playoffs tempered Berry\\'s anger.\\n\\n``It wasn\\'t pretty at the end,\" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as\\ngood as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn\\'t have, but\\nit did.\"\\n\\nStill, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game\\'s end.\\nDespite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this\\nseason, the Blues still made the playoffs. They\\'ll meet the Chicago Blackhawks\\nin a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at\\nChicago Stadium.\\n\\nThe Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,\\ntheir fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points\\nbehind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,\\nwhich played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its\\nfirst season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.\\n\\nThe poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous\\nBlues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.\\n\\n``It\\'s a shame we let down,\" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score\\ntwo goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.\\n``There was no need for a letdown. If we\\'d have kept working, it would have\\nended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.\"\\n\\nInstead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.\\n``We won, and that\\'s all that matters,\" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3\\nfor the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.\"\\n\\nSome players didn\\'t have a problem.\\n\\n``Just because the score was announced, our line didn\\'t quit,\" said Rich\\nSutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You\\ncan\\'t allow five goals like we did, that\\'s not right.\\n\\n``It was disappointing to see what was going on.\"\\n\\nBassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues\\' effort. Somehow,\\nhe missed the announcement of Minnesota\\'s loss.\\n\\n``I didn\\'t know it was final,\" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the\\nbench. I didn\\'t realize it was a final for some reason. We\\'re in the playoffs,\\nand that\\'s great, but it\\'s a little disappointing to play like we did at the\\nend.\"\\n\\nThe letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard\\noperators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score\\nshowed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third\\nperiod. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.\\n\\n``I told them I didn\\'t want to see the score, I didn\\'t want to know the score,\"\\nBerry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that\\'s the approach we took.\"\\n\\nIf Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might\\nbother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.\\n\\nUntil the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd\\ngoing at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,\\nMiller and Bassen took charge late in the period.\\n\\nWith the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked\\ndefenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the\\nrebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.\\n\\nThen, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski\\nafter defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.\\n\\nBassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the \\nrebound of Bret Hedican\\'s shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of\\nthe season and reminded him of a special friend.\\n\\nLast year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form\\nof cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.\\n\\n``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,\" Bassen said. ``He\\'s in heaven now, and\\nI know he was watching. I know he\\'s happy.\"\\n\\nMiller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo\\nat 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph\\'s shutout just 18 seconds\\nlater, making it 5-1.\\n\\nLess than a minute after the North Stars\\' final was announced, Tim Bergland\\nscored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass\\nfrom Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.\\n\\nThen, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third\\nperiod, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals\\nto Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third\\nperiod.\\n\\nThe goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan\\'s second goal stand up as the\\nwinner. ``We were in there,\" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.\"\\n\\n  %*%*%*%**%*%%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*\\n  *   __  ______________         ____________________________________    % \\n  %   \\\\ \\\\_)____________/         A L L E Z   L E S   B L U E S  ! ! !    * \\n  *    \\\\    __________/          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    % \\n  %     \\\\    ________/                                                   *\\n  *      \\\\   _______/                  Joe Ashkar                        % \\n  %       \\\\  \\\\                         Contact for the Blues             *\\n  *        \\\\  \\\\  SAINT LOUIS           jca2@cec1.wustl.edu               % \\n  %        (___)             BLUES                                       * \\n  *%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*%*% \\n',\n",

Such a state resembles more Nazi Germany and South Africa than\\nWestern democracies, such as the United States, in which Jews are free to\\nmarry whom they wish and do so in the thousands. My proposal may have\\ndrawbacks but it is meant to force anybody to anything, just to\\ncompensate for a certain time mixed couples for the hardships tehy\\nendure in a society which disapproves of intermarriage.When the day\\nwill come and Israel will become a truly civil and decmoractic society,\\nin which the state is not concerned with the religious or ethnic\\naffiliation of its constituency, such a Fund would not be needed any\\nmore. I don't mind if Jews wish to marry Jews and keep their\\ntraditions, why not ? But this is not the affairs of a state.

I am as concerned about the media\\'s complicity in this\\ngrowing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the\\ninvestigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from\\nany other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been\\nbehind it.  What\\'s going on here?\\n\\nLet\\'s look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.\\nI\\'m a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops\\nbecause I\\'ve found some of the techniques to be useful in business\\nnegotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR\\nknows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a\\npsychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had\\nprofessionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh\\'s behavior was\\nemminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from\\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their\\nisolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh\\'s religious\\norientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as\\nthe apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being\\nconsumed in the apocalypse.\\n\\nIMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated\\npsy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of\\naction designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly\\nappearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the\\ntanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.\\nThey KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,\\nobstensibly to perform \"gas insertions\" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push\\nhim over the edge.\\n\\nLook at some supporting evidence.  Koresh\\'s attorney mentioned on TV\\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh\\'s major concern was the biblical\\nrole of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\\non Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)\\nclaimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true\\nthey KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\\nwere pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and\\nreasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at\\nthe first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and\\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the\\n\"gas insertion\" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image\\nthat will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back\\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\\n\\nLet\\'s step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without\\nbloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency\\ninterested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation\\nof life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\\n\\nThe way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,\\nabandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\\narmor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited\\nhis ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A\\nsimple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell\\nhow he whipped the US government would have been something he could not\\nhave resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the\\ncompound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the\\nFBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the\\nrevenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.

Others steered clear of such puzzle books because \\nthey were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern \\nmathematics and didn\\'t mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn\\'t \\nknow how to solve mere arithmetic problems. Professional mathematicians were \\nno exception. Here\\'s what the Russian mathematician Alexander Khinchin, a \\nspecialist in statistics, wrote about arithmetic: \"I willingly confess that \\nany time a fifth-grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem, it was\\na hard work for me, and sometimes I failed completely. Of course, like most of \\nmy friends, I could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route\\n--constructing equations or sets of equations. But we were supposed to avoid \\nusing algebraic analysis at all costs! . . . By the way, it\\'s a fact that is \\nwell known and oft repeated that, as a rule, neither high school graduates, \\nnor students at teaching colleges, nor teachers beginning their careers\\n(nor, I must add, scientific researchers) can solve arithmetic problems. It \\nseems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth-grade \\nteachers.\"\\n\\nNow, I\\'m not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the \\nbookbag of anyone flying into space. But a sense of justice induces me to \\nrecommend one particular problem book, one that will satisfy the most \\nfastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a \\nrelatively short flight to the Moon but for a extended space voyage--say, to\\nVenus and back.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tOne for the \"road\"\\n\\n\\tThey both took out the books they brought for the road. Kingsley \\n\\tglanced at the Royal Astronomer\\'s book and saw a bright cover with \\n\\ta group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers. \"God \\n\\tknows what this kind of stuff leads to,\" thought Kingsley.\\n\\n\\tThe Royal Astronomer looked at Kingsley\\'s book and saw the History \\n\\tof Herodotus. \"Good Lord, next he\\'ll be reading Thucydides,\" thought \\n\\tthe Royal Astronomer.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Fred Hoyle, The Black Cloud\\n\\nThe book I\\'m talking about isn\\'t very big, but its 24 problems constitute 24 \\nelegant miniatures from seventh-century Armenia. Naive and wise at the same\\ntime, rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period, these \\nproblems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of Armenian \\narchitecture, the church on the island of Akhtamar in Lake Van (in what is \\nnow Turkey_. They are as inseparable from the image of Armenia as the elegant \\nletters of the Armenian alphabet, invented by Mesrop Mashtots, or the songs of \\nKomitas, or the paintings of Saryan.\\n\\nAn edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a \\nbibliographic rarity. It was published under the title Problems and Solutions\\nof Vardapet [1] Anania of Shirak, Armenian Mathematician of the Seventh \\nCentury (translated and published by I. A. Orbeli, Petrograd, 1918).\\n\\nThe abundance of close observations and wide-ranging information about the way \\nof life and customs of that remote epoch when Anania of Shirak lived and \\nworked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book. For many years \\nthe book was known only to researchers in the humanities--specialists in \\nArmenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn\\'t let just\\nanyone see it. Even now, after research by K. P. Patkanov, the learned monk \\nFather Kaloust, J.I. Orbeli, A. Abramyan, V. K. Chaloyan, and others has \\nbrought the works of Anania of Shirak to light in scholarly circles, the \\ngeneral reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable \\nproblem book.\\n\\n\\t\\tVardapet Anania of Shirak\\n\\n\\tOnce fell in love with the art of calculation, I thought that no \\n\\tphilosophical notion can be constructed without number, considering \\n\\tit the mother of all wisdom.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Anania of Shirak\\n\\nAmong ancient Armenian thinkers, Vardapet Anania of Shirak stands out because \\nof the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his \\nwork. Some of his works have been preserved. In addition to the Problems and\\nSolutions, the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation\\nof scholars: On Weights and Measures, Cosmography and Calendrical Theory, and\\nArmenian Geography of the Seventh Century A.D. (the authorship of the last\\nwork was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient Armenia, \\nMovses of Khoren).\\n\\nIn his autobiography, Anania of Shirak has this to say about himself:\\n\\n\\tI, Anania of Shirak, having studied all the science of our\\n\\tArmenian land and having learned the Holy Scripture intimately, \\n\\tin the expression of the psalmist, \"every day I illuminated the \\n\\teyes of my mind.\" Feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation,\\n\\tI came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy, \\n\\tthe mother of all sciences, without number. I could find in Armenia \\n\\tneither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the \\n\\tsciences. I therefore went to Greece and met in Theodosiople a man \\n\\tnamed Iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works. He told me\\n\\tthat in Forth Armenia [2] there lived a famous mathematician,\\n\\tChristosatur. I went this person and spent six months with him. But \\n        soon I noticed that Christosatur was a master not of all science but \\n        only of certain fragmentary facts.\\n\\n\\tI then went to Constantinople, where I met acquaintances who told me: \\n\\t\"Why did you go so far, when much closer to us, in Trebizon, on the \\n\\tcoast of Pontus [3] lives the Byzantine vardapet Tyukhik. He is full \\n\\tof wisdom, is known to kings, and knows Armenian literature.\" I asked \\n\\tthem how they knew this. They answered: \"We saw ourselves that many \\n\\tpeople traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man. \\n\\tIndeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of Constantinople,\\n\\tPhilagrus, traveled with us, bringing many young persons to become \\n\\tpupils of Tyukhik.\" When I heard this, I expressed my gratitude to \\n\\tGod, who had quenched the thirst of His slave.\\n\\n\\tI went to Tyukhik at the monastery of St. Eugene and explained why I \\n\\thad come. He received me graciously and said: \"I praise Our Lord that \\n\\tHe sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of St. \\n\\tGregory; I am glad that all your country will learn from me. I myself \\n\\tlived in Armenia for many years as a youth. Ignorance reigned there.\" \\n\\tVardapet Tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with \\n\\tme. The Lord bestowed upon me His blessing: I completely assimilated \\n\\tthe science of number, and with such success that my fellow students\\n\\tat the king\\'s court began to envy me.\\n\\n\\tI spent eight years with Tyukhik and studied many books that had not \\n\\tbeen translated into our language. For the vardapet had an innumerable \\n\\tcollection of books: secret and explicit, ecclesiastical and pagan, \\n\\tbooks on art, history, and medicine, books of chronologies. Why \\n\\tenumerate them by title? In a word, there is no book that Tyukhik did \\n\\tnot have. And he had such a gift from the Holy Spirit for translating\\n\\tthat when he sat down to translate something from the Greek into \\n\\tArmenian, he did not struggle as other translators did, and the \\n\\ttranslation read as if the work were written in that language \\n\\toriginally.\\n\\n\\tTyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had \\n\\tlearned the Armenian language. \"When I was young,\" he said, \"I lived \\n\\tin Trebizon, at the court of the military chief Ioannus Patricus, and \\n\\tfor a long time, up to the accession of Mauritius to the throne I \\n\\tserved as a military man in Armenia and learned your language and \\n\\tliterature. During one attack by Persian troops on the Greeks, I was \\n\\twounded and escaped to Antioch. I lost all my possessions. Praying to \\n\\tthe Lord to heal my wounds, I made a promise: \"If You prolong my life, \\n\\tI shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to \\n\\tcollecting treasures of knowledge.\" And the Lord heard my prayers. \\n\\tAfter I recovered I went to Jerusalem, and from there to Alexandria \\n\\tand Rome. Upon returning to Constantinople, I met a famous philosopher \\n\\tfrom Athens and studied with him for many years. After that I returned \\n\\tto my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people.\"\\n\\n\\tAfter some years that philosopher died. Not finding a replacement for \\n\\thim, the king and his courtiers sent for Tyukhik and invited him to \\n\\tassume the teacher\\'s position. Tyukhik, citing the promise he made to \\n\\tGod not to move far from the city, turned down the offer. But because\\n\\tof his wide leaning, people came streaming from all countries to study \\n\\twith him.\\n\\n\\tAnd I, the most insignificant of all Armenians, having learned from \\n\\thim this powerful science, desired by kings, brought it to our \\n\\tcountry, supported by no one, obligated only to my own industry, God\\'s \\n\\thelp, and the prayers of the Blessed Educator. And no one thanked me \\n\\tfor my efforts.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProblems and Solutions\\n\\n\\tA half and one sixth and one nine-ninth of all the books were printed\\n\\ton verge\\'; one fifth and one two-hundred-eighty-fifth--on rag paper; \\n\\tone forty-fifth and one eight-hundred-fifty-fifth--on vellum, and \\n\\tforty-five inscribed copies--on Dutch paper. And so, find how many \\n\\tcopies were printed in all.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t--Imitation of Anania of Shirak\\n\\nA Latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli (\"books have their own fate\").\\nThe fate of Problems and Solutions by Anania of Shirak is quite amazing. The\\nmanuscripts of Anania\\'s book were preserved only because, according to \\nArmenian historians, \"in ancient and medieval Armenia manuscripts were guarded \\nfrom invaders, like weapons, and cherished, like one\\'s own children.\" Biding\\ntheir time, the manuscripts lay in the Matenadaran, a renowned depository of \\nancient manuscripts (now the Mesrop Mashtots Institute of Ancient Manuscripts).\\nAnd its hour finally arrived. In 1896 the learned monk Father Kaloust used two \\nmanuscripts to publish the problem book, supplementing it with an introduction \\nand commentary. In 1918 the book was translated into Russian, edited, \\nannotated, and typeset by Iosef Orbeli, a prominent scholar (and later a \\nmember of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR).\\n\\nIn the translator\\'s words, the problems of Anania are \"amusing, full of life, \\nand simple.\" Orbeli goes on to say: \"The subjects of the problems are \\ngenerally taken from everyday life. The scene is predominantly his homeland \\nShirak and the surrounding countryside, and the dramatis personae, if they are \\nnamed, are the local princes--the Kamsarakans, including Nersekh, who was a \\ncontemporary of Anania.\" Like other ancient authors, Anania of Shirak used \\nonly \"aliquots\" -- that is, fractions with a numerator of 1. When it is\\nnecessary to write fractions with numerators other than 1, one has to \\nrepresent it as a sum of aliquots (see the epigraph above).\\n\\nLike any true work of art, the problems of Anania suffer terribly in the \\nretelling. You have to read the originals (albeit in translation) in their \\nfull glory. So let\\'s open Anania\\'s problem book--a gift from across the ages.\\n\\nProblems 1 and 8 relate to the Armenian uprising against the Persians in A.D. \\n572.\\n\\nProblem 1\\n\\nMy father told me the following story. During the famous wars between the \\nArmenians and the Persians, prince Zaurak Kamsarakan performed extraordinary \\nheroic deeds. Three times in a single month he attacked the Persian troops. \\nThe first time, he struck down half of the Persian army. The second time, \\npursuing the Persians, he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers. The third \\ntime, he destroyed one eleventh of the Persian army. The Persians who were \\nstill alive, numbering two hundred eighty, fled to Nakhichevan. And so, from \\nthis remainder, find how many Persian soldiers there were before the massacre.\\n\\nProblem 8\\n\\nDuring the famous Armenian uprising against the Persians, when Zaurak\\nKamsarakan killed Suren, one of the Armenian azats[4] sent an envoy to the\\nPersian king to report the baleful news. The envoy covered fifty miles in a \\nday. Fifteen days later, when he learned of this, Zaurak Kamsarakan sent \\nriders in pursuit to bring the envoy back. The riders covered eighty miles in \\na day. And so, find how many days it took them to catch the envoy.\\n\\nProblem 18 mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal. In the Russian \\ntranslation, they are all called \"dishes.\" But in the original Armenian, \\naccording to Orbeli\\'s note, the dishes in the first and second instances are \\ncalled mesur, and in the third instance scutel. Scutel is a common Armenian \\nword, but mesur had not been encountered in Armenian literature before \\nAnania\\'s Problems and Solutions.\\n\\nProblem 18\\n\\nThere was a tray in my house. I melted it down and made other vessels from the \\nmetal. From one third I made a mesur; from one fourth, another mesur; from\\none fifth, two goblets; from one sixth, two scutels; and from two hundred ten \\ndrams, I made a bowl. And now, find the weight of the tray.\\n\\nSeveral of the problems reflect the richness of the Caucasian fauna in \\nAnania\\'s time -- for instance, problem 7.\\n\\nProblem 7\\n\\nOnce I was in Marmet, the capital of the Kamsarakans. Strolling along the bank \\nof the river Akhuryan, I saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast. \\nWe caught a half and a quarter of the school, and all the fishes that slipped\\nout of the net ended up in a creel. When I looked in the creel, I found \\nforty-five fishes. And now, find how many fishes here were in all.\\n\\nThe temptation is great to present all 24 problems. But I\\'ll restrain myself\\nand offer you just one more.\\n\\nProblem 20 provides some interesting information about the wild animals that \\ninhabited Armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no\\nmention of them even in zoological reference books. The wild donkey, according \\nto the generally accepted view, never roamed the Armenian lands. Yet Anania of \\nShirak offers evidence to the contrary .\\n\\nProblem 20\\n\\nThe hunting preserve of Nersekh Kamsarakan, ter[5] of Shirak and Asharunik, \\nwas at the base of the mountain called Artin. One night great herds of wild\\ndonkey entered the preserve. The hunters could not cope with the donkeys and, \\nrunning to the village of Talin, told Nersekh about them. When he arrived with\\nhis brothers and azats and entered the preserve, they began killing the wild \\nbeasts. Half of the animals were caught in traps, one fourth were killed by \\narrows. The young, which constituted one twelfth of all the animals, were \\ncaught alive, and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears. And \\nso, find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre.\\n\\n\\t\\t\"Set in type by me, Iosef Orbeli\"\\n\\n\\tHis biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a \\n\\tbibliography.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t-- K Uzbashyan, Academician\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIosef Abgarovich Orbeli\\n\\nAnyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy (1/n of the small printing--n is the \\nsolution to the epigraph in the previous section) of the Russian translation \\nof Anania of Shirak\\'s Problems and Solutions, a thin book with yellowed pages,\\nhas probably noticed the variety of the fonts, the elegance of the borders, \\nand the high quality of the design, printing, and binding. Such great \\nattention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for \\na degree in bookmaking. And this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma \\nattesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it. An \\nadvertisement at the end of the book reads: \"This book was typeset in \\nDecember 1917 at the printing offices of the Russian Academy of Sciences by \\nme, Iosef Orbeli; the text was also proofread, laid out, and decorated with \\nborders by me. Various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project \\nto the end; the final pages of the book were typeset by M. Strolman.\"\\n\\nTypesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned \\norientalist Iosef Orbeli, who later became the director of the Hermitage \\nMuseum in Leningrad. He was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith. Orbeli had \\nalready become acquainted with the famous academic printing house Typis \\nAcademiae, founded in 1728 and known all over the scientific world for its \\nrich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters. In preparing to publish \\nthe corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of Armenian \\nchurches, Orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve \\nthe unique signs and ligatures. This complicated work was done by M. G.\\nStrolman. (Unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the \\nblockade of Leningrad in World War II.)\\n\\nWhen Orbeli came to the printing offices of the Academy of Sciences, times \\nwere hard. The only way to publish the newly translated Problems of Anania\\nwas for Orbeli to learn typesetting (he had always been attracted to the \\nprinter\\'s craft). In 1922 Orbeli became the director of printing at the \\nAcademy of Sciences. Even after he retired, he remained a tireless champion\\nof Russian academic typography.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tBack to Earth\\n\\n\\tThis book by definition does not exhaust all the most important \\n\\tworks in this domain.

AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.\\n\\nIf they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force\\ncompression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).\\n\\nIf you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend\\ninto,  then drag is reduced.   \\n\\nEssentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf\\nremain constant for all areas of the fuselage.

What happens to a Russian, to a Czech,\\ndoes not interest me in the slightest. What the nations can offer\\nin good blood of our type, we will take, if necessary by kidnapping\\ntheir children and raising them with us. Whether nations live in\\nprosperity or starve to death interests me only in so far as we\\nneed them as slaves for our culture; otherwise, it is of no interest\\nto me. Whether 10,000 Russian females fall down from exhaustion\\nwhile digging an anti-tank ditch interest me only in so far as\\nthe anti-tank ditch for Germany is finished. We shall never be rough\\nand heartless when it is not necessary, that is clear. We Germans,\\nwho are the only people in the world who have a decent attitude\\ntowards animals, will also assume a decent attitude towards these\\nhuman animals. But it is a crime against our own blood to worry\\nabout them and give them ideals, thus causing our sons and\\ngrandsons to have a more difficult time with them. When someone\\ncomes to me and says, \"I cannot dig the anti-tank ditch with women\\nand children, it is inhuman, for it will kill them\", then I\\nwould have to say, \"you are a murderer of your own blood because\\nif the anti-tank ditch is not dug, German soldiers will die, and\\nthey are the sons of German mothers.

Then the others will not do it. Besides,\\nprovisions will be made that a sufficient number of Polish women\\nand girls will come along as well so that a necessity of this\\nkind is out of the question.\\n\\nThe women will be brought before the courts without mercy, and\\nwhere the facts are not sufficiently proved - such borderline\\ncases always happen - they will be sent to a concentration camp.\\nThis we must do, unless these one million Poles and those\\nhundreds of thousands of workers of alien blood are to inflict\\nuntold damage on the German blood.

I\\nam told that people in Israel have to carry their ID cards at all\\ntimes and present them at many public places, almost every day.\\nThese ID cards make clear who the holder is, a Jew or an Arab.\\nYou maintain that this mainly because of religious services\\nprovided. But do you really believe that this is the reason ?\\nCould you provide evidence that this is the case and that it\\nserves no other purpose ?\\n\\nIn the answer to my second questions, concerning the fact that\\nIsrael has no fixed borders, you state that Israel's borders were\\n'shaped and reshaped by both war and peace'. According to what I\\nread, the first Zionists in the beginning of the Century, had\\nplans for the Jewish State to extend into what is Lebanon and into\\nTransjordan (Jordan). I also read that it was the express wish of\\nBen-Gurion to not declare Israel's borders, when Israel was\\nestablished, as this might restrict Israel's opportunities for\\nlater expansion. Israel often claims it right of existence on the\\nfact that Jews lived there 2000 years ago or that God promised the\\nland to them. But according to biblical sources, the area God\\npromised would extend all the way to Iraq. And what were the\\nborders in biblical times which Israel considers proper to use\\ntoday ?  Finally, if Israel wants peace, why can't it declare what\\nit considers its legitimate and secure borders, which might be a\\nbase for negotiations? Having all the above facts in mind, one\\ncannot blame Arab countries to fear Israeli expansionism, as a\\nnumber of wars have proved (1948, 1956, 1967, 1982).\\n\\nYour answer to my third question is typical of a Stalinist public\\nofficial. I don't think your answer is honest.  You refer me to\\nVanunu's revelations about Israel's nuclear arsenal without\\nevaluating the truthfullness of his revelations. Now if he said\\nthe truth, then why should he been punished, and if he lied, why\\nshould he be punished? I would appreciate more honesty.\\n\\nSomebody provided an answer to the fourth question, concerning\\n'hidden prisoners' in Israeli prisons. He posted an article from\\nMa'ariv documenting such cases.  It seems that such prisoners do\\nexist in Israel. What do you think about that ?\\n\\nYou imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a\\nway to 'cast aspersions upon Israel'. Such terms have often been\\nused by the Soviet Union against dissidents: They call the Soviet\\nUnion into disrepute. If my questions are not disturbing, they\\nwould not call forth such hysterical answers. My questions are\\nclearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts. I would be\\nvery happy if you could convince me that what I am told about\\nIsrael were just fabrications, but alas you have failed to do so.\\nI suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest\\ndiscussion. This is a sign of weakness, not of strength.\\n\\nI hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth.\\n\\n\",\n",

       "  \"From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder)\\nSubject: Re: Elevator to the top floor\\nOrganization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, AL\\nLines: 56\\n\\n\\nReading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their\\nERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive\\nstrength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\\nthat can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,\\nor 75 Statute miles.\\n\\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss\\ntype, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.\\nLet us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \\nstrength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant\\nsection column.  \\n\\nA constant section column is not the limit on how high you can\\nbuild something if you allow a tapering of the cross section\\nas you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound\\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\\ncalculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross\\nsectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \\nbelow the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\\n\\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section\\nto support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile\\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\\nto the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical\\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limits based\\non how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\\nmuch load you need to support on the ground (for which you need\\na foundation that the bedrock can support.\\n\\nLet us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction\\ncost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,\\nassuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\\nis just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass\\nratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower\\nheight becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant\\natmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still\\nhave to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses\\nwill be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of\\nrocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,\\nbut which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus\\nthey represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting\\nfrom the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.\\n\\nThis analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind\\nloads.  These will require more structural support over the first\\n15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low\\nenough value for it not to be a big factor.\\n\\nDani Eder\\n\\n-- \\nDani Eder/Meridian Investment Company/(205)464-2697(w)/232-7467(h)/\\nRt.1, Box 188-2, Athens AL 35611/Location: 34deg 37' N 86deg 43' W +100m alt.\\n\",\n",

On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but\\noff ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the\\nleafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of\\nthe seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played \"home\" games in places\\nlike Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff \"home\"\\ngames will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One\\ndemostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs\\' bus and\\nrocked it and broke windows in the St John\\'s Memorial Stadium.\\nDespite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs\\nwill return to St John\\'s once the strike ends.\\n===================================================\\nSENATORS SOLD\\nThe New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to\\nthe Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian\\nNHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear\\nthey intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic\\nProvinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL\\nhead office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting\\nin May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it \\nclear the league was more interested in the stability of the \\nAHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining\\nthe 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. \\n\\nThe Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown\\nNew Brunswick and are expected to move there.\\n==================================================\\nDALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON\\nAfter announcing that they would pull their affiliation out\\nof Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. \\n\\nThe Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing\\ntheir minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they\\nwanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.\\n\\nEnter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining\\n6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks\\nin the New Brunswick city.\\n\\nThe deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if\\nthe season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold\\n1400 for this year.\\n============================================================\\nSAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL\\nThe Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of\\nSaint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200\\nExhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion\\nfrnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.\\n=========================================================\\nCAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE\\nDespite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore\\nSkipjacks to Maine. The Caps\\' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,\\nannounced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.\\nThere was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced\\na limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players\\nincluding 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited\\nfarm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.\\n======================================================\\nAHL GAME OF THE WEEK\\nIn early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced\\nby, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian\\nMaritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of\\nthe week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there\\nhas been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and\\nshown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic\\nSports Network in Canada (but I\\'m not sure about that). I am not\\nsure if playoff games will be covered.\\n=====================================================\\nUTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?\\nThere were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next\\nseason. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern\\ncity and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.\\n=====================================================\\nWHAT THE AHL MIGHT LOOK LIKE NEXT YEAR\\n\\nONE OPTION\\t\\t\\t\\tANOTHER OPTION\\n\\t\\t\\t\\nNorthern Division\\t\\t\\tSouthern Division\\nADIRONDACK RED WINGS\\t\\t\\tADIRONDACK\\nSPRINGFIELD INDIANS\\t\\t\\tSPRINGFIELD\\nPROVIDENCE BRUINS\\t\\t\\tPROVIDENCE\\nCD ISLANDERS\\t\\t\\t\\tCDI\\nPORTLAND PIRATES\\t\\t\\tHERSHEY\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBINGHAMTON\\nSouthern Division\\t\\t\\tROCHESTER\\nHERSHEY BEARS\\t\\t\\t\\tHAMILTON\\nBINGHAMTON RANGERS\\t\\t\\tUTICA\\nROCHESTER AMERICANS\\nHAMILTON CANUCKS\\t\\t\\tAtlantic Division\\nUTICA (?)

Drugs are very illegal and they\\'re\\nhere.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is\\nnecessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should\\nhave always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don\\'t.\\nUnless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more\\nmagical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more\\nheavily patrolled) then I really can\\'t accept that argument.\\n\\n>Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:\\n>What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!\\n\\n       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,\\ntwo-thirds of which are suicides.

However, this makes the per-gun death rate about\\nhalf the per-car death rate.\\n\\n>The issue (I hope..):\\n>I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.\\n>Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is....

The\\nfct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,\\nwhether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally\\nirrelevent.\\n\\n      Yet weapons are *built*.  I\\'d suggest, then, that the murderous\\nimpulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.\\n\\n      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt\\nto kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even\\nif we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.\\n\\n>If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them\\n>or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,\\n>it\\'s the \\'axer\\' ??\\n>(An example, don\\'t flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)\\n\\n\\n       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.\\n(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per \\nse, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe\\'s\\ncountries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don\\'t really think we\\'ve got\\nmore knives or fists.  \\n\\n       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.\\nhave been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms\\nof prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they\\nare doing, you won\\'t solve your problem.  And if the problem is \\nviolent crime, you shouldn\\'t concentrate on the tools instead.  The\\n*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of\\n99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that\\nyou can\\'t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.\\n\\n>Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect\\n>themselves.

Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition\\nwon\\'t make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.\\n\\n       You have to examine which problem you\\'re referring to.  If\\nyou\\'re discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is\\na perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.

An\\n>increase from 38 points to 53 points is not going to do that.  The arrival\\n>of Mario Lemieux is what did it. \\n\\nYou can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that\\nit wasn\\'t Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.\\na winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And\\nbefore anybody jumps in and says I\\'m nit-picking and mincing words, go back\\nand read from where this thread started...\\n\\nIt might help to think about what would go through a fan\\'s mind who suddenly\\nfound an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it \"gee, Mario Lemieux is\\namazing, I\\'ll go watch him play\", or was it \"gee, now we\\'ve got a *kick*\\n*ass* guy on *our* side, I\\'ll go watch him play\".  I think it was the latter.\\n\\n> Similar thing happened in L.A.   Before\\n>Gretzky\\'s arrival, about 12000 per game.  After, constant sellouts.  They\\n>are STILL selling out every game despite showing little or no improvement\\n>since Gretzky\\'s first year there.  How do you explain it?  People are going\\n>to see Gretzky.  they certainly aren\\'t going to see a winner, they haven\\'t\\n>GOT a winner.  They\\'ve had MUCH better teams in their past history than\\n>they currently have, yet they didn\\'t draw as well then.\\n\\nI don\\'t think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don\\'t go to\\nthe games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket\\nholders in LA don\\'t always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings\\ninitial success following Gretzky\\'s arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)\\nand corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in\\nattendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  \\n\\nWhether or not the Kings are a \\'winner\\' is debatable.  I claim that since\\nGretzky\\'s arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim\\nthat McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler\\ndynasty...but that\\'s another story and included only because I don\\'t like\\nMcNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and\\nthat undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising\\nsales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little\\ntailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the\\nForum even if the tickets were sold.\\n\\n>I think in the case of a Lemieux or Gretzky, the player can transcend\\n>winning as the major drawing power.  \\n\\nFor the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it\\'s inevitable that the team\\nwill improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they\\nmake people around them better.\\n\\n>But winning sure as hell helps.  ;-)\\n\\nWell, at least we are in full agreement here!\\n\\n>This does not make Roger\\'s point any more valid, but the Jets aren\\'t\\n\\nSo are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn\\'t resist...>\\n\\n>getting a HUGE jump in productivity, yet they ARE getting a huge\\n>jump in attendance.

The split\\nbetween the train and test set is based upon a messages posted before\\nand after a specific date.\\n\\nThis module contains two loaders. The first one,\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups`,\\nreturns a list of the raw texts that can be fed to text feature\\nextractors such as :class:`sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`\\nwith custom parameters so as to extract feature vectors.\\nThe second one, :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized`,\\nreturns ready-to-use features, i.e., it is not necessary to use a feature\\nextractor.\\n\\n**Data Set Characteristics:**\\n\\n    =================   ==========\\n    Classes                     20\\n    Samples total            18846\\n    Dimensionality               1\\n    Features                  text\\n    =================   ==========\\n\\nUsage\\n~~~~~\\n\\nThe :func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function is a data\\nfetching / caching functions that downloads the data archive from\\nthe original `20 newsgroups website`_, extracts the archive contents\\nin the ``~/scikit_learn_data/20news_home`` folder and calls the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.load_files` on either the training or\\ntesting set folder, or both of them::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\')\\n\\n  >>> from pprint import pprint\\n  >>> pprint(list(newsgroups_train.target_names))\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\',\\n   \\'comp.graphics\\',\\n   \\'comp.os.ms-windows.misc\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.sys.mac.hardware\\',\\n   \\'comp.windows.x\\',\\n   \\'misc.forsale\\',\\n   \\'rec.autos\\',\\n   \\'rec.motorcycles\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.baseball\\',\\n   \\'rec.sport.hockey\\',\\n   \\'sci.crypt\\',\\n   \\'sci.electronics\\',\\n   \\'sci.med\\',\\n   \\'sci.space\\',\\n   \\'soc.religion.christian\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.guns\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.mideast\\',\\n   \\'talk.politics.misc\\',\\n   \\'talk.religion.misc\\']\\n\\nThe real data lies in the ``filenames`` and ``target`` attributes. The target\\nattribute is the integer index of the category::\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (11314,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([ 7,  4,  4,  1, 14, 16, 13,  3,  2,  4])\\n\\nIt is possible to load only a sub-selection of the categories by passing the\\nlist of the categories to load to the\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups` function::\\n\\n  >>> cats = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\', categories=cats)\\n\\n  >>> list(newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.filenames.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target.shape\\n  (1073,)\\n  >>> newsgroups_train.target[:10]\\n  array([0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0])\\n\\nConverting text to vectors\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIn order to feed predictive or clustering models with the text data,\\none first need to turn the text into vectors of numerical values suitable\\nfor statistical analysis. This can be achieved with the utilities of the\\n``sklearn.feature_extraction.text`` as demonstrated in the following\\nexample that extract `TF-IDF`_ vectors of unigram tokens\\nfrom a subset of 20news::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer\\n  >>> categories = [\\'alt.atheism\\', \\'talk.religion.misc\\',\\n  ...               \\'comp.graphics\\', \\'sci.space\\']\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> vectors.shape\\n  (2034, 34118)\\n\\nThe extracted TF-IDF vectors are very sparse, with an average of 159 non-zero\\ncomponents by sample in a more than 30000-dimensional space\\n(less than .5% non-zero features)::\\n\\n  >>> vectors.nnz / float(vectors.shape[0])\\n  159.01327...\\n\\n:func:`sklearn.datasets.fetch_20newsgroups_vectorized` is a function which \\nreturns ready-to-use token counts features instead of file names.\\n\\n.. _`20 newsgroups website`: http://people.csail.mit.edu/jrennie/20Newsgroups/\\n.. _`TF-IDF`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf-idf\\n\\n\\nFiltering text for more realistic training\\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\\n\\nIt is easy for a classifier to overfit on particular things that appear in the\\n20 Newsgroups data, such as newsgroup headers. Many classifiers achieve very\\nhigh F-scores, but their results would not generalize to other documents that\\naren\\'t from this window of time.\\n\\nFor example, let\\'s look at the results of a multinomial Naive Bayes classifier,\\nwhich is fast to train and achieves a decent F-score::\\n\\n  >>> from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB\\n  >>> from sklearn import metrics\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.88213...\\n\\n(The example :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py` shuffles\\nthe training and test data, instead of segmenting by time, and in that case\\nmultinomial Naive Bayes gets a much higher F-score of 0.88. Are you suspicious\\nyet of what\\'s going on inside this classifier?)\\n\\nLet\\'s take a look at what the most informative features are:\\n\\n  >>> import numpy as np\\n  >>> def show_top10(classifier, vectorizer, categories):\\n  ...     feature_names = np.asarray(vectorizer.get_feature_names())\\n  ...     for i, category in enumerate(categories):\\n  ...         top10 = np.argsort(classifier.coef_[i])[-10:]\\n  ...         print(\"%s: %s\" % (category, \" \".join(feature_names[top10])))\\n  ...\\n  >>> show_top10(clf, vectorizer, newsgroups_train.target_names)\\n  alt.atheism: edu it and in you that is of to the\\n  comp.graphics: edu in graphics it is for and of to the\\n  sci.space: edu it that is in and space to of the\\n  talk.religion.misc: not it you in is that and to of the\\n\\n\\nYou can now see many things that these features have overfit to:\\n\\n- Almost every group is distinguished by whether headers such as\\n  ``NNTP-Posting-Host:`` and ``Distribution:`` appear more or less often.\\n- Another significant feature involves whether the sender is affiliated with\\n  a university, as indicated either by their headers or their signature.\\n- The word \"article\" is a significant feature, based on how often people quote\\n  previous posts like this: \"In article [article ID], [name] <[e-mail address]>\\n  wrote:\"\\n- Other features match the names and e-mail addresses of particular people who\\n  were posting at the time.\\n\\nWith such an abundance of clues that distinguish newsgroups, the classifiers\\nbarely have to identify topics from text at all, and they all perform at the\\nsame high level.\\n\\nFor this reason, the functions that load 20 Newsgroups data provide a\\nparameter called **remove**, telling it what kinds of information to strip out\\nof each file. **remove** should be a tuple containing any subset of\\n``(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``, telling it to remove headers, signature\\nblocks, and quotation blocks respectively.\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_test = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'test\\',\\n  ...                                      remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                      categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(pred, newsgroups_test.target, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.77310...\\n\\nThis classifier lost over a lot of its F-score, just because we removed\\nmetadata that has little to do with topic classification.\\nIt loses even more if we also strip this metadata from the training data:\\n\\n  >>> newsgroups_train = fetch_20newsgroups(subset=\\'train\\',\\n  ...                                       remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\'),\\n  ...                                       categories=categories)\\n  >>> vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(newsgroups_train.data)\\n  >>> clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=.01)\\n  >>> clf.fit(vectors, newsgroups_train.target)\\n  MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01, class_prior=None, fit_prior=True)\\n\\n  >>> vectors_test = vectorizer.transform(newsgroups_test.data)\\n  >>> pred = clf.predict(vectors_test)\\n  >>> metrics.f1_score(newsgroups_test.target, pred, average=\\'macro\\')\\n  0.76995...\\n\\nSome other classifiers cope better with this harder version of the task. Try\\nrunning :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py` with and without\\nthe ``--filter`` option to compare the results.\\n\\n.. topic:: Recommendation\\n\\n  When evaluating text classifiers on the 20 Newsgroups data, you\\n  should strip newsgroup-related metadata. In scikit-learn, you can do this by\\n  setting ``remove=(\\'headers\\', \\'footers\\', \\'quotes\\')``. The F-score will be\\n  lower because it is more realistic.\\n\\n.. topic:: Examples\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_model_selection_grid_search_text_feature_extraction.py`\\n\\n   * :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_text_plot_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`\\n'}"
